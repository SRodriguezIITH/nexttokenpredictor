Systems of Units. Some Important Conversion Factors
The most important systems of units are shown in the table below. The mks system is also known as
the International System of Units (abbreviated SI), and the abbreviations sec (instead of s),
gm (instead of g), and nt (instead of N) are also used.

Purpose and Structure of the Book
This book provides a comprehensive, thorough, and up-to-date treatment of engineering
mathematics. It is intended to introduce students of engineering, physics, mathematics,
computer science, and related fields to those areas of applied mathematics that are most
relevant for solving practical problems. A course in elementary calculus is the sole
prerequisite. (However, a concise refresher of basic calculus for the student is included
on the inside cover and in Appendix 3.)
The subject matter is arranged into seven parts as follows:
A. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in Chapters 1–6
B. Linear Algebra. Vector Calculus. See Chapters 7–10
C. Fourier Analysis. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). See Chapters 11 and 12
D. Complex Analysis in Chapters 13–18
E. Numeric Analysis in Chapters 19–21
F. Optimization, Graphs in Chapters 22 and 23
G. Probability, Statistics in Chapters 24 and 25.
These are followed by five appendices: 1. References, 2. Answers to Odd-Numbered
Problems, 3. Auxiliary Materials (see also inside covers of book), 4. Additional Proofs,
5. Table of Functions. This is shown in a block diagram on the next page.
The parts of the book are kept independent. In addition, individual chapters are kept as
independent as possible. (If so needed, any prerequisites—to the level of individual
sections of prior chapters—are clearly stated at the opening of each chapter.) We give the
instructor maximum flexibility in selecting the material and tailoring it to his or her
need. The book has helped to pave the way for the present development of engineering
mathematics. This new edition will prepare the student for the current tasks and the future
by a modern approach to the areas listed above. We provide the material and learning
tools for the students to get a good foundation of engineering mathematics that will help
them in their careers and in further studies.
General Features of the Book Include:
• Simplicity of examples to make the book teachable—why choose complicated
examples when simple ones are as instructive or even better?
• Independence of parts and blocks of chapters to provide flexibility in tailoring
courses to specific needs.
• Self-contained presentation, except for a few clearly marked places where a proof
would exceed the level of the book and a reference is given instead.
• Gradual increase in difficulty of material with no jumps or gaps to ensure an
enjoyable teaching and learning experience.
• Modern standard notation to help students with other courses, modern books, and
journals in mathematics, engineering, statistics, physics, computer science, and others.
Furthermore, we designed the book to be a single, self-contained, authoritative, and
convenient source for studying and teaching applied mathematics, eliminating the need
for time-consuming searches on the Internet or time-consuming trips to the library to get
a particular reference book.

Preface ix
Four Underlying Themes of the Book
The driving force in engineering mathematics is the rapid growth of technology and the
sciences. New areas—often drawing from several disciplines—come into existence.
Electric cars, solar energy, wind energy, green manufacturing, nanotechnology, risk
management, biotechnology, biomedical engineering, computer vision, robotics, space
travel, communication systems, green logistics, transportation systems, financial
engineering, economics, and many other areas are advancing rapidly. What does this mean
for engineering mathematics? The engineer has to take a problem from any diverse area
and be able to model it. This leads to the first of four underlying themes of the book.
1. Modeling is the process in engineering, physics, computer science, biology,
chemistry, environmental science, economics, and other fields whereby a physical situation
or some other observation is translated into a mathematical model. This mathematical
model could be a system of differential equations, such as in population control (Sec. 4.5),
a probabilistic model (Chap. 24), such as in risk management, a linear programming
problem (Secs. 22.2–22.4) in minimizing environmental damage due to pollutants, a
financial problem of valuing a bond leading to an algebraic equation that has to be solved
by Newton’s method (Sec. 19.2), and many others.
The next step is solving the mathematical problem obtained by one of the many
techniques covered in Advanced Engineering Mathematics.
The third step is interpreting the mathematical result in physical or other terms to
see what it means in practice and any implications.
Finally, we may have to make a decision that may be of an industrial nature or
recommend a public policy. For example, the population control model may imply
the policy to stop fishing for 3 years. Or the valuation of the bond may lead to a
recommendation to buy. The variety is endless, but the underlying mathematics is
surprisingly powerful and able to provide advice leading to the achievement of goals
toward the betterment of society, for example, by recommending wise policies
concerning global warming, better allocation of resources in a manufacturing process,
or making statistical decisions (such as in Sec. 25.4 whether a drug is effective in treating
a disease).
While we cannot predict what the future holds, we do know that the student has to
practice modeling by being given problems from many different applications as is done
in this book. We teach modeling from scratch, right in Sec. 1.1, and give many examples
in Sec. 1.3, and continue to reinforce the modeling process throughout the book.
2. Judicious use of powerful software for numerics(listed in the beginning of PartE)
and statistics (Part G) is of growing importance. Projects in engineering and industrial
companies may involve large problems of modeling very complex systems with hundreds
of thousands of equations or even more. They require the use of such software. However,
our policy has always been to leave it up to the instructor to determine the degree of use of
computers, from none or little use to extensive use. More on this below.
3. The beauty of engineering mathematics. Engineering mathematics relies on
relatively few basic concepts and involves powerful unifying principles. We point them
out whenever they are clearly visible, such as in Sec. 4.1 where we “grow” a mixing
problem from one tank to two tanks and a circuit problem from one circuit to two circuits,
thereby also increasing the number of ODEs from one ODE to two ODEs. This is an
example of an attractive mathematical model because the “growth” in the problem is
reflected by an “increase” in ODEs.
fpref.qxd 11/8/10 3:16 PM Page x
x Preface
4. To clearly identify the conceptual structure of subject matters. For example,
complex analysis (in Part D) is a field that is not monolithic in structure but was formed
by three distinct schools of mathematics. Each gave a different approach, which we clearly
mark. The first approach is solving complex integrals by Cauchy’s integral formula (Chaps.
13 and 14), the second approach is to use the Laurent series and solve complex integrals
by residue integration (Chaps. 15 and 16), and finally we use a geometric approach of
conformal mapping to solve boundary value problems (Chaps. 17 and 18). Learning the
conceptual structure and terminology of the different areas of engineering mathematics is
very important for three reasons:
a. It allows the student to identify a new problem and put it into the right group of
problems. The areas of engineering mathematics are growing but most often retain their
conceptual structure.
b.The student can absorb new information more rapidlyby being able to fit it into the
conceptual structure.
c.Knowledge of the conceptual structure and terminology is also important when using
the Internet to search for mathematical information. Since the search proceeds by putting
in key words (i.e., terms) into the search engine, the student has to remember the important
concepts (or be able to look them up in the book) that identify the application and area
of engineering mathematics.
Big Changes in This Edition
1 Problem Sets Changed
The problem sets have been revised and rebalanced with some problem sets having more
problems and some less, reflecting changes in engineering mathematics. There is a greater
emphasis on modeling. Now there are also problems on the discrete Fourier transform
(in Sec. 11.9).
2 Series Solutions of ODEs, Special Functions and Fourier Analysis Reorganized
Chap. 5, on series solutions of ODEs and special functions, has been shortened. Chap. 11
on Fourier Analysis now contains Sturm–Liouville problems, orthogonal functions, and
orthogonal eigenfunction expansions (Secs. 11.5, 11.6), where they fit better conceptually
(rather than in Chap. 5), being extensions of Fourier’s idea of using orthogonal functions.
3 Openings of Parts and Chapters Rewritten As Well As Parts of Sections
In order to give the student a better idea of the structure of the material (see Underlying
Theme 4 above), we have entirely rewritten the openings of parts and chapters.
Furthermore, large parts or individual paragraphs of sections have been rewritten or new
sentences inserted into the text. This should give the students a better intuitive
understanding of the material (see Theme 3 above), let them draw conclusions on their
own, and be able to tackle more advanced material. Overall, we feel that the book has
become more detailed and leisurely written.
4 Student Solutions Manual and Study Guide Enlarged
Upon the explicit request of the users, the answers provided are more detailed and
complete. More explanations are given on how to learn the material effectively by pointing
out what is most important.
5 More Historical Footnotes, Some Enlarged
Historical footnotes are there to show the student that many people from different countries
working in different professions, such as surveyors, researchers in industry, etc., contributed
fpref.qxd 11/8/10 3:16 PM Page xi
Preface xi
to the field of engineering mathematics. It should encourage the students to be creative in
their own interests and careers and perhaps also to make contributions to engineering
mathematics.
Further Changes and New Features
• Parts of Chap. 1 on first-order ODEs are rewritten. More emphasis on modeling, also
new block diagram explaining this concept in Sec. 1.1. Early introduction of Euler’s
method in Sec. 1.2 to familiarize student with basic numerics. More examples of
separable ODEs in Sec. 1.3.
• For Chap. 2, on second-order ODEs, note the following changes: For ease of reading,
the first part of Sec. 2.4, which deals with setting up the mass-spring system, has
been rewritten; also some rewriting in Sec. 2.5 on the Euler–Cauchy equation.
• Substantially shortened Chap. 5, Series Solutions of ODEs. Special Functions:
combined Secs. 5.1 and 5.2 into one section called “Power Series Method,” shortened
material in Sec. 5.4 Bessel’s Equation (of the first kind), removed Sec. 5.7
(Sturm–Liouville Problems) and Sec. 5.8 (Orthogonal Eigenfunction Expansions) and
moved material into Chap. 11 (see “Major Changes” above).
• New equivalent definition of basis (Sec. 7.4).
• In Sec. 7.9, completely new part on composition of linear transformations with
two new examples. Also, more detailed explanation of the role of axioms, in
connection with the definition of vector space.
• New table of orientation (opening of Chap. 8 “Linear Algebra: Matrix Eigenvalue
Problems”) where eigenvalue problems occur in the book. More intuitive explanation
of what an eigenvalue is at the begining of Sec. 8.1.
• Better definition of cross product (in vector differential calculus) by properly
identifying the degenerate case (in Sec. 9.3).
• Chap. 11 on Fourier Analysis extensively rearranged: Secs. 11.2 and 11.3
combined into one section (Sec. 11.2), old Sec. 11.4 on complex Fourier Series
removed and new Secs. 11.5 (Sturm–Liouville Problems) and 11.6 (Orthogonal
Series) put in (see “Major Changes” above). New problems (new!) in problem set
11.9 on discrete Fourier transform.
• New section 12.5on modeling heat flow from a body in space by setting up the heat
equation. Modeling PDEs is more difficult so we separated the modeling process
from the solving process (in Sec. 12.6).
• Introduction to Numericsrewritten for greater clarity and better presentation; new
Example 1 on how to round a number. Sec. 19.3 on interpolation shortened by
removing the less important central difference formula and giving a reference instead.
• Large new footnote with historical details in Sec. 22.3, honoring George Dantzig,
the inventor of the simplex method.
• Traveling salesman problemnow described better as a “difficult” problem, typical
of combinatorial optimization (in Sec. 23.2). More careful explanation on how to
compute the capacity of a cut set in Sec. 23.6 (Flows on Networks).
• In Chap. 24, material on data representation and characterization restructured in
terms of five examples and enlarged to include empirical rule on distribution of
fpref.qxd 11/8/10 3:16 PM Page xii
xii Preface
data, outliers, and the z-score (Sec. 24.1). Furthermore, new example on encription
(Sec. 24.4).
• Lists of software for numerics (Part E) and statistics (Part G) updated.
• References in Appendix 1 updated to include new editions and some references to
websites.
Use of Computers
The presentation in this book is adaptable to various degrees of use of software,
Computer Algebra Systems (CAS’s), or programmable graphic calculators, ranging
from no use, very little use, medium use, to intensive use of such technology. The choice
of how much computer content the course should have is left up to the instructor, thereby
exhibiting our philosophy of maximum flexibility and adaptability. And, no matter what
the instructor decides, there will be no gaps or jumps in the text or problem set. Some
problems are clearly designed as routine and drill exercises and should be solved by
hand (paper and pencil, or typing on your computer). Other problems require more
thinking and can also be solved without computers. Then there are problems where the
computer can give the student a hand. And finally, the book has CAS projects, CAS
problems and CAS experiments, which do require a computer, and show its power in
solving problems that are difficult or impossible to access otherwise. Here our goal is
to combine intelligent computer use with high-quality mathematics. The computer
invites visualization, experimentation, and independent discovery work. In summary,
the high degree of flexibility of computer use for the book is possible since there are
plenty of problems to choose from and the CAS problems can be omitted if desired.
Note that information on software (what is available and where to order it) is at the
beginning of Part E on Numeric Analysis and Part G on Probability and Statistics. Since
Mapleand Mathematicaare popular Computer Algebra Systems, there are two computer
guides available that are specifically tailored to Advanced Engineering Mathematics:
E.Kreyszig and E.J. Norminton, Maple Computer Guide, 10thEditionand Mathematica
Computer Guide, 10thEdition.Their use is completely optional as the text in the book is
written without the guides in mind.

Many physical laws and relations can be expressed mathematically in the form of differential
equations. Thus it is natural that this book opens with the study of differential equations and
their solutions. Indeed, many engineering problems appear as differential equations.
The main objectives of Part A are twofold: the study of ordinary differential equations
and their most important methods for solving them and the study of modeling.
Ordinary differential equations(ODEs) are differential equations that depend on a single
variable. The more difficult study of partial differential equations (PDEs), that is,
differential equations that depend on several variables, is covered in Part C.
Modeling is a crucial general process in engineering, physics, computer science, biology,
medicine, environmental science, chemistry, economics, and other fields that translates a
physical situation or some other observations into a “mathematical model.” Numerous
examples from engineering (e.g., mixing problem), physics (e.g., Newton’s law of cooling),
biology (e.g., Gompertz model), chemistry (e.g., radiocarbon dating), environmental science
(e.g., population control), etc. shall be given, whereby this process is explained in detail,
that is, how to set up the problems correctly in terms of differential equations.
For those interested in solving ODEs numerically on the computer, look at Secs. 21.1–21.3
of Chapter 21 of Part F, that is, numeric methods for ODEs. These sections are kept
independent by design of the other sections on numerics. This allows for the study of
numerics for ODEs directly after Chap. 1 or 2.

First-Order ODEs
Chapter 1 begins the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by deriving them from
physical or other problems (modeling), solving them by standard mathematical methods,
and interpreting solutions and their graphs in terms of a given problem. The simplest ODEs
to be discussed are ODEs of the first order because they involve only the first derivative
of the unknown function and no higher derivatives. These unknown functions will usually
be denoted by y x or y t when the independent variable denotes time t. The chapter ends
1 2 12
with a study of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of ODEs in Sec. 1.7.
Understanding the basics of ODEs requires solving problems by hand (paper and pencil,
or typing on your computer, but first without the aid of a CAS). In doing so, you will
gain an important conceptual understanding and feel for the basic terms, such as ODEs,
direction field, and initial value problem. If you wish, you can use your Computer Algebra
System (CAS) for checking solutions.
COMMENT. Numerics for first-order ODEs can be studied immediately after this
chapter. See Secs. 21.1–21.2, which are independent of other sections on numerics.
Prerequisite: Integral calculus.
Sections that may be omitted in a shorter course: 1.6, 1.7.

Basic Concepts. Modeling
Physical If we want to solve an engineering problem (usually of a physical nature), we first
System
have to formulate the problem as a mathematical expression in terms of variables,
functions, and equations. Such an expression is known as a mathematical modelof the
given problem. The process of setting up a model, solving it mathematically, and
Mathematical interpreting the result in physical or other terms is called mathematical modeling or,
Model
briefly, modeling.
Modeling needs experience, which we shall gain by discussing various examples and
problems. (Your computer may often help you in solvingbut rarely in setting upmodels.)
Mathematical
Solution Now many physical concepts, such as velocity and acceleration, are derivatives. Hence
a model is very often an equation containing derivatives of an unknown function. Such
a model is called a differential equation. Of course, we then want to find a solution (a
function that satisfies the equation), explore its properties, graph it, find values of it, and
Physical
Interpretation interpret it in physical terms so that we can understand the behavior of the physical system
in our given problem. However, before we can turn to methods of solution, we must first

Fig. 2. Some applications of differential equations
An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equation that contains one or several
derivatives of an unknown function, which we usually call y(x) (or sometimes y(t) if the
independent variable is time t). The equation may also contain y itself, known functions
of x (or t), and constants. For example,
(1) yr (cid:3)cos x
(2)
ys (cid:4)9y(cid:3)e(cid:2)2x
(3)
yr yt (cid:2)3yr2(cid:3)0

4 CHAP. 1 First-Order ODEs
r
are ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Here, as in calculus, y denotes dy dx,
ys (cid:3)d2y dx2, etc. The term ordinary distinguishes them from partial differen> tial
>
equations (PDEs), which involve partial derivatives of an unknown function of two
or more variables. For instance, a PDE with unknown function u of two variables x
and y is
02u 02u
(cid:4) (cid:3)0.
0x2 0y2
PDEs have important engineering applications, but they are more complicated than ODEs;
they will be considered in Chap. 12.
An ODE is said to be of ordernif the nth derivative of the unknown function yis the
highest derivative of y in the equation. The concept of order gives a useful classification
into ODEs of first order, second order, and so on. Thus, (1) is of first order, (2) of second
order, and (3) of third order.
In this chapter we shall consider first-order ODEs. Such equations contain only the
r
first derivative y and may contain y and any given functions of x. Hence we can write
them as
(4) F(x, y, yr )(cid:3)0
or often in the form
yr (cid:3)f(x, y).
This is called the explicit form, in contrast to the implicit form(4). For instance, the implicit
ODE x(cid:2)3yr (cid:2) 4y2(cid:3)0 (where x(cid:5)0) can be written explicitly as yr (cid:3) 4x3y2.
Concept of Solution
A function
y(cid:3)h(x)
is called a solution of a given ODE (4) on some open interval a (cid:6) x (cid:6) b if h(x) is
defined and differentiable throughout the interval and is such that the equation becomes
r r
an identity if y and y are replaced with h and h , respectively. The curve (the graph) of
h is called a solution curve.
Here, open interval a (cid:6) x (cid:6) b means that the endpoints a and b are not regarded as
points belonging to the interval. Also, a (cid:6) x (cid:6) bincludes infinite intervals(cid:2)(cid:7) (cid:6) x (cid:6) b,
a (cid:6) x (cid:6) (cid:7), (cid:2)(cid:7) (cid:6) x (cid:6) (cid:7) (the real line) as special cases.
EXAMPLE 1 Verification of Solution
Verify that y(cid:3)c x(can arbitrary constant) is a solution of the ODE xyr(cid:3)(cid:2)yfor all x(cid:5)0.Indeed, differentiate
y(cid:3)c xto get yr> (cid:3)(cid:2)c x2.Multiply this by x, obtaining xyr(cid:3)(cid:2)c x;thus, xyr(cid:3)(cid:2)y,the given ODE. (cid:2)

of c, for instance, 2.75 or 0 or (cid:2)8,gives one of these curves. Figure 3 shows some of them, for c(cid:3)(cid:2)3, (cid:2)2,

We see that each ODE in these examples has a solution that contains an arbitrary
constantc. Such a solution containing an arbitrary constant cis called a general solution
of the ODE.
(We shall see that cis sometimes not completely arbitrary but must be restricted to some
interval to avoid complex expressions in the solution.)
We shall develop methods that will give general solutions uniquely(perhaps except for
notation). Hence we shall say the general solution of a given ODE (instead of a general
solution).
Geometrically, the general solution of an ODE is a family of infinitely many solution
curves, one for each value of the constant c. If we choose a specific c(e.g., c(cid:3)6.45or 0
or (cid:2)2.01) we obtain what is called a particular solutionof the ODE. A particular solution
does not contain any arbitrary constants.
In most cases, general solutions exist, and every solution not containing an arbitrary
constant is obtained as a particular solution by assigning a suitable value to c. Exceptions
to these rules occur but are of minor interest in applications; see Prob. 16 in Problem
Set 1.1.
Initial Value Problem
In most cases the unique solution of a given problem, hence a particular solution, is
obtained from a general solution by an initial condition y(x )(cid:3)y , with given values
0 0
x and y , that is used to determine a value of the arbitrary constant c. Geometrically
0 0
this condition means that the solution curve should pass through the point (x , y )
0 0
in the xy-plane. An ODE, together with an initial condition, is called an initial value
problem. Thus, if the ODE is explicit, yr (cid:3)f(x, y), the initial value problem is of
the form
(5) yr (cid:3)f(x, y), y(x )(cid:3)y .

Solution. The general solution is y(x)(cid:3)ce3x; see Example 3. From this solution and the initial condition
we obtain y(0)(cid:3)ce0(cid:3)c(cid:3)5.7. Hence the initial value problem has the solution y(x)(cid:3)5.7e3x. This is a

More on Modeling
The general importance of modeling to the engineer and physicist was emphasized at the
beginning of this section. We shall now consider a basic physical problem that will show
the details of the typical steps of modeling. Step 1: the transition from the physical situation
(the physical system) to its mathematical formulation (its mathematical model); Step 2:
the solution by a mathematical method; and Step 3: the physical interpretation of the result.
This may be the easiest way to obtain a first idea of the nature and purpose of differential
equations and their applications. Realize at the outset that your computer (your CAS)
may perhaps give you a hand in Step 2, but Steps 1 and 3 are basically your work.
c01.qxd 7/30/10 8:14 PM Page 7
SEC. 1.1 Basic Concepts. Modeling 7
And Step 2 requires a solid knowledge and good understanding of solution methods
available to you—you have to choose the method for your work by hand or by the
computer. Keep this in mind, and always check computer results for errors (which may
arise, for instance, from false inputs).
EXAMPLE 5 Radioactivity. Exponential Decay
Given an amount of a radioactive substance, say, 0.5 g (gram), find the amount present at any later time.
Physical Information.Experiments show that at each instant a radioactive substance decomposes—and is thus
decaying in time—proportional to the amount of substance present.
Step 1. Setting up a mathematical model of the physical process.Denote by y(t)the amount of substance still
present at any time t. By the physical law, the time rate of change yr (t)(cid:3)dy dtis proportional to y(t). This
>
gives the first-order ODE
dy
(6) (cid:3)(cid:2)ky
dt
where the constant k is positive, so that, because of the minus, we do get decay (as in [B] of Example 3).
The value of k is known from experiments for various radioactive substances (e.g., k(cid:3)1.4(cid:3)10(cid:2)11 sec(cid:2)1,
approximately, for radium 226Ra).
Now the given initial
am8 o8
u nt is 0.5 g, and we can call the corresponding instant t(cid:3)0.Then we have the
initial conditiony(0)(cid:3)0.5.This is the instant at which our observation of the process begins. It motivates
the term initial condition(which, however, is also used when the independent variable is not time or when
we choose a t other than t(cid:3)0). Hence the mathematical model of the physical process is the initial value
problem
dy
(7) (cid:3)(cid:2)ky, y(0)(cid:3)0.5.
dt
Step 2. Mathematical solution.As in (B) of Example 3 we conclude that the ODE (6) models exponential decay
and has the general solution (with arbitrary constant cbut definite given k)
(8) y(t)(cid:3)ce(cid:2)kt.
We now determine c by using the initial condition. Since y(0)(cid:3)cfrom (8),this gives y(0)(cid:3)c(cid:3)0.5.Hence
the particular solution governing our process is (cf. Fig. 5)
(9) y(t)(cid:3)0.5e(cid:2)kt (k (cid:8) 0).
Always check your result—it may involve human or computer errors! Verify by differentiation (chain rule!)
that your solution (9) satisfies (7)as well as y(0)(cid:3)0.5:
dy
(cid:3)(cid:2)0.5ke(cid:2)kt(cid:3)(cid:2)k(cid:3)0.5e(cid:2)kt(cid:3)(cid:2)ky, y(0)(cid:3)0.5e0(cid:3)0.5.
dt
Step 3. Interpretation of result.Formula (9) gives the amount of radioactive substance at time t. It starts from
the correct initial amount and decreases with time because kis positive. The limit of yas t:(cid:7)is zero. (cid:2)

A first-order ODE

y(x)is the slope of y(x). Hence a solution curve of (1) that passes through a point (x , y )

must have, at that point, the slope y (x ) equal to the value of f at that point; that is,

Using this fact, we can develop graphic or numeric methods for obtaining approximate
solutions of ODEs (1). This will lead to a better conceptual understanding of an ODE (1).
Moreover, such methods are of practical importance since many ODEs have complicated
solution formulas or no solution formulas at all, whereby numeric methods are needed.
Graphic Method of Direction Fields. Practical Example Illustrated in Fig. 7. We
can show directions of solution curves of a given ODE (1) by drawing short straight-line
segments (lineal elements) in the xy-plane. This gives a direction field (or slope field)
into which you can then fit (approximate) solution curves. This may reveal typical
properties of the whole family of solutions.

If you have no CAS, first draw a few level curvesf(x, y) (cid:3)const of f(x, y), then parallel
lineal elements along each such curve (which is also called an isocline, meaning a curve
of equal inclination), and finally draw approximation curves fit to the lineal elements.
We shall now illustrate how numeric methods work by applying the simplest numeric
method, that is Euler’s method, to an initial value problem involving ODE (2). First we
give a brief description of Euler’s method.

Separable ODEs. Modeling
Many practically useful ODEs can be reduced to the form
(1) g(y) yr (cid:3)f(x)
by purely algebraic manipulations. Then we can integrate on both sides with respect to x,
obtaining
(cid:3) (cid:3)
(2) g(y) yr dx(cid:3) f(x) dx (cid:4)c.
On the left we can switch to yas the variable of integration. By calculus, yr dx(cid:3)dy, so that
(cid:3) (cid:3)
(3) g(y) dy (cid:3) f(x) dx (cid:4)c.
If f and g are continuous functions, the integrals in (3) exist, and by evaluating them we
obtain a general solution of (1). This method of solving ODEs is called the method of
separating variables, and (1) is called a separable equation, because in (3) the variables
are now separated: x appears only on the right and y only on the left.
EXAMPLE 1 Separable ODE
The ODE
yr(cid:3)1(cid:4)y2is

dy
(cid:3)dx. By integration, arctan y(cid:3)x(cid:4)c or y(cid:3)tan (x(cid:4)c).

It is very important to introduce the constant of integration immediately when the integration is performed.
Ifwewrote arctan y(cid:3)x,then y(cid:3)tan x,and thenintroduced c, we would have obtained y(cid:3)tan x(cid:4)c,which
is not a solution (when c(cid:5)0). Verify this. (cid:2)

In September 1991 the famous Iceman (Oetzi), a mummy from the Neolithic period of the Stone Age found in
the ice of the Oetztal Alps (hence the name “Oetzi”) in Southern Tyrolia near the Austrian–Italian border, caused
a scientific sensation. When did Oetzi approximately live and die if the ratio of carbon 14Cto carbon 12Cin

EXAMPLE 5 Mixing Problem
Mixing problems occur quite frequently in chemical industry. We explain here how to solve the basic model
involving a single tank. The tank in Fig. 11 contains 1000 gal of water in which initially 100 lb of salt is dissolved.
Brine runs in at a rate of 10 gal min, and each gallon contains 5 lb of dissoved salt. The mixture in the tank is
>
kept uniform by stirring. Brine runs out at 10 gal min. Find the amount of salt in the tank at any time t.
>
Solution. Step 1. Setting up a model.Let y(t)denote the amount of salt in the tank at time t. Its time rate
of change is
yr(cid:3)Salt inflow rate(cid:2)Salt outflow rate Balance law.
5 lb times 10 gal gives an inflow of 50 lb of salt. Now, the outflow is 10 gal of brine. This is 10 1000(cid:3)0.01
>
((cid:3) 1%)of the total brine content in the tank, hence 0.01 of the salt content y(t), that is, 0.01 y(t). Thus the
model is the ODE
(4)
yr(cid:3)50(cid:2)0.01y(cid:3)(cid:2)0.01(y(cid:2)5000).
Step 2. Solution of the model.The ODE (4) is separable. Separation, integration, and taking exponents on both
sides gives
dy
(cid:3)(cid:2)0.01 dt, ln ƒy(cid:2)5000ƒ (cid:3)(cid:2)0.01t(cid:4)c*, y(cid:2)5000(cid:3)ce(cid:2)0.01t.
y(cid:2)5000
Initially the tank contains 100 lb of salt. Hence y(0)(cid:3)100 is the initial condition that will give the unique
solution. Substituting y(cid:3)100and t(cid:3)0in the last equation gives 100(cid:2)5000(cid:3)ce0(cid:3)c.Hence c(cid:3)(cid:2)4900.
Hence the amount of salt in the tank at time tis
(5) y(t)(cid:3)5000(cid:2)4900e(cid:2)0.01t.
This function shows an exponential approach to the limit 5000 lb; see Fig. 11. Can you explain physically that
y(t)should increase with time? That its limit is 5000 lb? Can you see the limit directly from the ODE?
The model discussed becomes more realistic in problems on pollutants in lakes (see Problem Set 1.5, Prob. 35)
or drugs in organs. These types of problems are more difficult because the mixing may be imperfect and the flow
(cid:2)
rates (in and out) may be different and known only very roughly.

EXAMPLE 6 Heating an Office Building (Newton’s Law of Cooling3)
Suppose that in winter the daytime temperature in a certain office building is maintained at 70°F. The heating
is shut off at 10 P.M.and turned on again at 6 A.M.On a certain day the temperature inside the building at 2A.M.
was found to be 65°F. The outside temperature was 50°F at 10 P.M.and had dropped to 40°F by 6 A.M.What
was the temperature inside the building when the heat was turned on at 6 A.M.?
Physical information.Experiments show that the time rate of change of the temperature Tof a body B(which
conducts heat well, for example, as a copper ball does) is proportional to the difference between T and the
temperature of the surrounding medium (Newton’s law of cooling).
Solution. Step 1. Setting up a model.Let T(t)be the temperature inside the building and T the outside

Such experimental laws are derived under idealized assumptions that rarely hold exactly. However, even if a
model seems to fit the reality only poorly (as in the present case), it may still give valuable qualitative information.
To see how good a model is, the engineer will collect experimental data and compare them with calculations
from the model.
Step 2. General solution.We cannot solve (6) because we do not know T , just that it varied between 50°F
A
and 40°F, so we follow the Golden Rule:If you cannot solve your problem, try to solve a simpler one.We
solve (6) with the unknown function T replaced with the average of the two known values, or 45°F. For physical

reasons we may expect that this will give us a reasonable approximate value of Tin the building at 6 A.M.

GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ (1646–1716) invented (independently) the differential and integral calculus.
Newton discovered many basic physical laws and created the method of investigating physical problems by
means of calculus. His Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural

EXAMPLE 7 Leaking Tank. Outflow of Water Through a Hole (Torricelli’s Law)
This is another prototype engineering problem that leads to an ODE. It concerns the outflow of water from a
cylindrical tank with a hole at the bottom (Fig. 13). You are asked to find the height of the water in the tank at
any time if the tank has diameter 2 m, the hole has diameter 1 cm, and the initial height of the water when the
hole is opened is 2.25 m. When will the tank be empty?
Physical information.Under the influence of gravity the outflowing water has velocity
(7) v(t)(cid:3)0.60022gh(t) (Torricelli’s law4),
where h(t) is the height of the water above the hole at time t, and g(cid:3)980 cm sec2(cid:3)32.17 ft sec2 is the
> >
acceleration of gravity at the surface of the earth.
Solution. Step 1. Setting up the model.To get an equation, we relate the decrease in water level h(t)to the
outflow. The volume ¢Vof the outflow during a short time ¢tis
¢V(cid:3)Av ¢t (A(cid:3)Area of hole).
¢Vmust equal the change ¢V*of the volume of the water in the tank. Now
¢V*(cid:3)(cid:2)B ¢h (B(cid:3)Cross-sectional area of tank)
where ¢h ((cid:8) 0)is the decrease of the height h(t)of the water. The minus sign appears because the volume of
the water in the tank decreases. Equating ¢Vand ¢V*gives
(cid:2)B ¢h(cid:3)Av ¢t.
We now express v according to Torricelli’s law and then let ¢t (the length of the time interval considered)
approach 0—this is a standard wayof obtaining an ODE as a model. That is, we have
¢h A A
(cid:3)(cid:2) v(cid:3)(cid:2) 0.60012gh(t)

and by letting ¢t : 0we obtain the ODE

stream has a smaller cross section than the area of the hole.

function u(x, y) such that
0u 0u
(4) (a) (cid:3)M, (b) (cid:3)N.
0x 0y
From this we can derive a formula for checking whether (1) is exact or not, as follows.
Let M and N be continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives in a region in
the xy-plane whose boundary is a closed curve without self-intersections. Then by partial
differentiation of (4) (see App. 3.2 for notation),
0M 02u
(cid:3) ,
0y 0y 0x
0N 02u
(cid:3) .
0x 0x 0y
By the assumption of continuity the two second partial derivaties are equal. Thus
0M 0N

0y 0x

This condition is not only necessary but also sufficient for (1) to be an exact differential
equation. (We shall prove this in Sec. 10.2 in another context. Some calculus books, for
instance, [GenRef 12], also contain a proof.)
If (1) is exact, the function u(x, y) can be found by inspection or in the following
systematic way. From (4a) we have by integration with respect to x
(cid:3)
(6) u(cid:3) M dx(cid:4)k(y);
in this integration, y is to be regarded as a constant, and k(y)plays the role of a “constant”
of integration. To determine k(y), we derive 0u 0y from (6), use (4b) to get dk dy, and
> >
integrate dk dy to get k. (See Example 1, below.)

Formula (6) was obtained from (4a). Instead of (4a) we may equally well use (4b).
Then, instead of (6), we first have by integration with respect to y
(cid:3)
(6*) u(cid:3) N dy(cid:4)l(x).
To determine l(x), we derive 0u 0x from (6*), use (4a) to get dl dx, and integrate. We

illustrate all this by the following typical examples.
EXAMPLE 1 An Exact ODE
Solve
(7) cos (x(cid:4)y) dx(cid:4)(3y2(cid:4)2y(cid:4)cos (x(cid:4)y)) dy(cid:3)0.
Solution. Step 1. Test for exactness.Our equation is of the form (1) with
M(cid:3)cos (x(cid:4)y),
N(cid:3)3y2(cid:4)2y(cid:4)cos (x(cid:4)y).
Thus
0M
(cid:3)(cid:2)sin (x(cid:4)y),
0y
0N
(cid:3)(cid:2)sin (x(cid:4)y).
0x
From this and (5) we see that (7) is exact.
Step 2. Implicit general solution.From (6) we obtain by integration
(cid:3) (cid:3)
(8) u(cid:3) M dx(cid:4)k(y)(cid:3) cos (x(cid:4)y) dx(cid:4)k(y)(cid:3)sin (x(cid:4)y)(cid:4)k(y).
To find k(y),we differentiate this formula with respect to yand use formula (4b), obtaining
0u dk
(cid:3)cos (x(cid:4)y)(cid:4) (cid:3)N(cid:3)3y2(cid:4)2y(cid:4)cos (x(cid:4)y).
0y dy
Hence dk dy(cid:3)3y2(cid:4)2y.By integration, k(cid:3)y3(cid:4)y2(cid:4)c*.Inserting this result into (8) and observing (3),

we obtain the answer
u(x, y)(cid:3)sin (x(cid:4)y)(cid:4)y3(cid:4)y2(cid:3)c.

Step 3. Checking an implicit solution. We can check by differentiating the implicit solution u(x, y)(cid:3)c
implicitly and see whether this leads to the given ODE (7):
0u 0u
(9) du(cid:3) dx(cid:4) dy(cid:3)cos (x(cid:4)y) dx(cid:4)(cos (x(cid:4)y)(cid:4)3y2(cid:4)2y) dy(cid:3)0.
0x 0y
(cid:2)
This completes the check.
EXAMPLE 2 An Initial Value Problem
Solve the initial value problem
(10) (cos y sinh x(cid:4)1) dx(cid:2)sin y cosh x dy(cid:3)0, y(1)(cid:3)2.
Solution. You may verify that the given ODE is exact. We find u. For a change, let us use (6*),
(cid:3)
u(cid:3)(cid:2) sin y cosh x dy(cid:4)l(x)(cid:3)cos y cosh x(cid:4)l(x).
From this, 0u 0x(cid:3)cos y sinh x(cid:4)dl dx(cid:3)M(cid:3)cos y sinh x(cid:4)1.Hence dl dx(cid:3)1.By integration, l(x)(cid:3)x(cid:4)c*.
> > >
This gives the general solution u(x, y)(cid:3)cos y cosh x(cid:4)x(cid:3)c.From the initial condition, cos 2 cosh 1(cid:4)1(cid:3)
0.358(cid:3)c.Hence the answer is cos ycosh x(cid:4)x(cid:3)0.358.Figure 17 shows the particular solutions for c(cid:3)0, 0.358

EXAMPLE 3 WARNING! Breakdown in the Case of Nonexactness
The equation (cid:2)y dx(cid:4)x dy(cid:3)0 is not exact because M(cid:3)(cid:2)y and N(cid:3)x, so that in (5), 0M 0y(cid:3)(cid:2)1 but

Now, 0u 0yshould equal N(cid:3)x,by (4b). However, this is impossible because k(y)can depend only on y. Try

(6*); it will also fail. Solve the equation by another method that we have discussed.
Reduction to Exact Form. Integrating Factors
The ODE in Example 3 is (cid:2)y dx(cid:4)x dy(cid:3)0. It is not exact. However, if we multiply it
by 1 x2, we get an exact equation [check exactness by (5)!],

This example gives the idea. All we did was to multiply a given nonexact equation, say,
(12) P(x, y) dx(cid:4)Q(x, y) dy(cid:3)0,
by a function F that, in general, will be a function of both xand y.The result was an equation
(13) FP dx (cid:4)FQ dy(cid:3)0
that is exact, so we can solve it as just discussed. Such a function F(x, y) is then called
an integrating factor of (12).
EXAMPLE 4 Integrating Factor
The integrating factor in (11) is F(cid:3)1 x2.Hence in this case the exact equation (13) is

These are straight lines y(cid:3)cxthrough the origin. (Note that x(cid:3)0is also a solution of (cid:2)y dx(cid:4)x dy(cid:3)0.)
It is remarkable that we can readily find other integrating factors for the equation (cid:2)y dx(cid:4)x dy(cid:3)0,namely,
1 y2, 1 (xy),and 1 (x2(cid:4)y2),because

How to Find Integrating Factors
In simpler cases we may find integrating factors by inspection or perhaps after some trials,
keeping (14) in mind. In the general case, the idea is the following.
For M dx(cid:4)N dy(cid:3)0 the exactness condition (5) is 0M 0y(cid:3) 0N 0x. Hence for (13),
> >
FP dx(cid:4)FQ dy(cid:3)0, the exactness condition is
0 0
(15) (FP)(cid:3) (FQ).
0y 0x
By the product rule, with subscripts denoting partial derivatives, this gives
F P(cid:4)FP (cid:3)F Q(cid:4)FQ .
y y x x
In the general case, this would be complicated and useless. So we follow the Golden Rule:
If you cannot solve your problem, try to solve a simpler one—the result may be useful
(and may also help you later on). Hence we look for an integrating factor depending only
on one variable: fortunately, in many practical cases, there are such factors, as we shall
see. Thus, let F(cid:3)F(x). Then F (cid:3)0, and F (cid:3)Fr (cid:3)dF dx, so that (15) becomes
y x >
FP (cid:3)Fr Q(cid:4)FQ .

This proves the following theorem.
THEOREM 1 Integrating Factor F(x)
If (12) is such that the right side R of (16) depends only on x, then (12) has an
integrating factor F(cid:3)F(x), which is obtained by integrating (16) and taking
exponents on both sides.
(cid:3)
(17) F(x)(cid:3)exp R(x) dx.
Similarly, if F*(cid:3)F*(y), then instead of (16) we get

and we have the companion
THEOREM 2 Integrating Factor F*(y)
If (12) is such that the right side R* of (18) depends only on y, then (12) has an
integrating factor F*(cid:3)F*(y), which is obtained from (18) in the form
(cid:3)
(19) F*(y)(cid:3)exp R*(y) dy.
EXAMPLE 5 Application of Theorems 1 and 2. Initial Value Problem
Using Theorem 1 or 2, find an integrating factor and solve the initial value problem

Hence (19) gives the integrating factor F*(y)(cid:3)e(cid:2)y.From this result and (20) you get the exact equation
(ex(cid:4)y) dx(cid:4)(x(cid:2)e(cid:2)y) dy(cid:3)0.

of u(x, y)(cid:3)c,obtained by a CAS, a convenient way in cases in which it is impossible or difficult to cast a
solution into explicit form. Note the curve that (nearly) satisfies the initial condition.

Linear ODEs. Bernoulli Equation.
Population Dynamics
Linear ODEs or ODEs that can be transformed to linear form are models of various
phenomena, for instance, in physics, biology, population dynamics, and ecology, as we
shall see. A first-order ODE is said to be linear if it can be brought into the form
(1) yr (cid:4)p(x)y(cid:3)r(x),
by algebra, and nonlinear if it cannot be brought into this form.
The defining feature of the linear ODE (1) is that it is linear in both the unknown
function yand its derivative yr (cid:3)dy dx,whereas pand rmay be anygiven functions of
>
x. If in an application the independent variable is time, we write t instead of x.
r r
If the first term is f(x)y (instead of y ), divide the equation by f(x)to get the standard
r
form (1), with y as the first term, which is practical.
For instance, yr cos x (cid:4)y sin x (cid:3)x is a linear ODE, and its standard form is
yr (cid:4)y tan x (cid:3)x sec x.
The function r(x) on the right may be a force, and the solution y(x) a displacement in
a motion or an electrical current or some other physical quantity. In engineering, r(x) is
frequently called the input, and y(x)is called the outputor the responseto the input (and,
if given, to the initial condition).
c01.qxd 7/30/10 8:15 PM Page 28
28 CHAP. 1 First-Order ODEs
Homogeneous Linear ODE. We want to solve (1) in some interval a (cid:6) x (cid:6) b, call
it J, and we begin with the simpler special case that r(x) is zero for all x in J. (This is
sometimes written r(x)(cid:4)0.) Then the ODE (1) becomes
(2) yr (cid:4)p(x)y(cid:3)0
and is called homogeneous. By separating variables and integrating we then obtain
dy (cid:3)
(cid:3)(cid:2)p(x)dx, thus ln ƒyƒ (cid:3)(cid:2) p(x)dx(cid:4)c*.
y
Taking exponents on both sides, we obtain the general solution of the homogeneous
ODE (2),
(3) y(x)(cid:3)ce(cid:2)(cid:2)p(x) dx (c(cid:3)(cid:12)ec* when y(cid:13)0);
here we may also choose c(cid:3)0 and obtain the trivial solution y(x)(cid:3)0 for all x in that
interval.
Nonhomogeneous Linear ODE. We now solve (1) in the case that r(x) in (1) is not
everywhere zero in the interval Jconsidered. Then the ODE (1) is called nonhomogeneous.
It turns out that in this case, (1) has a pleasant property; namely, it has an integrating factor
depending only on x. We can find this factor F(x) by Theorem 1 in the previous section
or we can proceed directly, as follows. We multiply (1) by F(x), obtaining
(1*) Fyr (cid:4)pFy(cid:3)rF.
The left side is the derivative
(Fy)r (cid:3)Fr y(cid:4)Fyr
of the product Fy if
pFy(cid:3)Fr

pF(cid:3)Fr

By separating variables, dF F(cid:3)p dx. By integration, writing h(cid:3) (cid:2)p dx,
>
(cid:3)
lnƒFƒ (cid:3)h(cid:3) p dx, thus F(cid:3)eh.
With this F and hr (cid:3)p, Eq. (1*) becomes

By integration,
(cid:3)
ehy(cid:3) ehr dx(cid:4)c.
Dividing by eh, we obtain the desired solution formula

This reduces solving (1) to the generally simpler task of evaluating integrals. For ODEs
for which this is still difficult, you may have to use a numeric method for integrals from
Sec. 19.5 or for the ODE itself from Sec. 21.1. We mention that hhas nothing to do with
h(x) in Sec. 1.1 and that the constant of integration in h does not matter; see Prob. 2.
The structure of (4) is interesting. The only quantity depending on a given initial
condition is c. Accordingly, writing (4) as a sum of two terms,

EXAMPLE 3 Hormone Level
Assume that the level of a certain hormone in the blood of a patient varies with time. Suppose that the time rate
of change is the difference between a sinusoidal input of a 24-hour period from the thyroid gland and a continuous
removal rate proportional to the level present. Set up a model for the hormone level in the blood and find its
general solution. Find the particular solution satisfying a suitable initial condition.
Solution. Step 1. Setting up a model.Let y(t)be the hormone level at time t. Then the removal rate is Ky(t).
The input rate is A(cid:4)B cos vt,where v(cid:3)2p 24(cid:3)p 12and Ais the average input rate; here A(cid:15)Bto make

the input rate nonnegative. The constants A, B, Kcan be determined from measurements. Hence the model is the
linear ODE
yr (t)(cid:3)In(cid:2)Out(cid:3)A(cid:4)B cos vt(cid:2)Ky(t), thus yr(cid:4)Ky(cid:3)A(cid:4)B cos vt.
The initial condition for a particular solution y is y (0)(cid:3)y with t(cid:3)0 suitably chosen, for example,

general solution (evaluate (cid:2)eKt cos vt dtby integration by parts)

The last term decreases to 0 as tincreases, practically after a short time and regardless of c(that is, of the initial
condition). The other part of y(t)is called the steady-state solutionbecause it consists of constant and periodic
terms. The entire solution is called the transient-state solutionbecause it models the transition from rest to the
steady state. These terms are used quite generally for physical and other systems whose behavior depends on time.

Reduction to Linear Form. Bernoulli Equation
Numerous applications can be modeled by ODEs that are nonlinear but can be transformed
to linear ODEs. One of the most useful ones of these is the Bernoulli equation7
(9) yr (cid:4)p(x)y(cid:3)g(x)ya (a any real number).
7JAKOB BERNOULLI (1654–1705), Swiss mathematician, professor at Basel, also known for his contribution
to elasticity theory and mathematical probability. The method for solving Bernoulli’s equation was discovered by
Leibniz in 1696. Jakob Bernoulli’s students included his nephew NIKLAUS BERNOULLI (1687–1759), who
contributed to probability theory and infinite series, and his youngest brother JOHANN BERNOULLI (1667–1748),
who had profound influence on the development of calculus, became Jakob’s successor at Basel, and had among
his students GABRIEL CRAMER (see Sec. 7.7) and LEONHARD EULER (see Sec. 2.5). His son DANIEL
BERNOULLI (1700–1782) is known for his basic work in fluid flow and the kinetic theory of gases.

Population Dynamics
The logistic equation (11) plays an important role in population dynamics, a field
that models the evolution of populations of plants, animals, or humans over time t.
If B(cid:3)0, then (11) is yr (cid:3)dy dt (cid:3)Ay. In this case its solution (12) is y (cid:3)(1 c)eAt
> >
and gives exponential growth, as for a small population in a large country (the
United States in early times!). This is called Malthus’s law. (See also Example 3 in
Sec. 1.1.)
The term (cid:2)By2 in (11) is a “braking term” that prevents the population from growing
without bound. Indeed, if we write yr (cid:3)Ay 1(cid:2)(B A)y , we see that if y (cid:6) A B, then
yr (cid:8) 0, so that an initially small population 3 keeps g> row4 ing as long as y (cid:6) A B> . But if
y (cid:8) A B, then yr (cid:6) 0 and the population is decreasing as long as y (cid:8) A B.> The limit
> >
is the same in both cases, namely, A B. See Fig. 21.
>
We see that in the logistic equation (11) the independent variable t does not occur
explicitly. An ODE yr (cid:3)f(t, y) in which t does not occur explicitly is of the form
(13) yr (cid:3)f(y)
and is called an autonomous ODE. Thus the logistic equation (11) is autonomous.
Equation (13) has constant solutions, called equilibrium solutions or equilibrium
points. These are determined by the zeros of f(y), because f(y)(cid:3)0 gives yr (cid:3)0 by
(13); hence y(cid:3)const. These zeros are known as critical points of (13). An
equilibrium solution is called stable if solutions close to it for some t remain close
to it for all further t. It is called unstable if solutions initially close to it do not remain
close to it as t increases. For instance, y(cid:3)0 in Fig. 21 is an unstable equilibrium
solution, and y(cid:3)4 is a stable one. Note that (11) has the critical points y(cid:3)0 and
y(cid:3)A B.

EXAMPLE 5 Stable and Unstable Equilibrium Solutions. “Phase Line Plot”
The ODE yr(cid:3)(y(cid:2)1)(y(cid:2)2)has the stable equilibrium solution y (cid:3)1and the unstable y (cid:3)2,as the direction

field in Fig. 22 suggests. The values y and y are the zeros of the parabola f(y)(cid:3)(y(cid:2)1)(y(cid:2)2)in the figure.

Now, since the ODE is autonomous, we can “condense” the direction field to a “phase line plot” giving y and
1
y,and the direction (upward or downward) of the arrows in the field, and thus giving information about the
2 (cid:2)
stability or instability of the equilibrium solutions.

Orthogonal Trajectories. Optional
An important type of problem in physics or geometry is to find a family of curves that
intersects a given family of curves at right angles. The new curves are called orthogonal
trajectories of the given curves (and conversely). Examples are curves of equal
temperature (isotherms)and curves of heat flow, curves of equal altitude (contour lines)
on a map and curves of steepest descent on that map, curves of equal potential
(equipotential curves, curves of equal voltage—the ellipses in Fig. 24) and curves of
electric force (the parabolas in Fig. 24).
Here the angle of intersectionbetween two curves is defined to be the angle between
the tangents of the curves at the intersection point. Orthogonal is another word for
perpendicular.
In many cases orthogonal trajectories can be found using ODEs. In general, if we
consider G(x, y, c)(cid:3)0to be a given family of curves in the xy-plane, then each value of
c gives a particular curve. Since c is one parameter, such a family is called a one-
parameter family of curves.
In detail, let us explain this method by a family of ellipses
(1) 1 x2(cid:4)y2(cid:3)c (c (cid:8) 0)

and illustrated in Fig. 24. We assume that this family of ellipses represents electric
equipotential curves between the two black ellipses (equipotential surfaces between two
elliptic cylinders in space, of which Fig. 24 shows a cross-section). We seek the
orthogonal trajectories, the curves of electric force. Equation (1) is a one-parameter family
with parameter c. Each value of c ((cid:8) 0) corresponds to one of these ellipses.
Step 1. Find an ODE for which the given family is a general solution. Of course, this
ODE must no longer contain the parameter c. Differentiating (1), we have x(cid:4)2yyr (cid:3)0.
Hence the ODE of the given curves is

Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
for Initial Value Problems
The initial value problem
ƒyrƒ (cid:4) ƒyƒ (cid:3)0, y(0) (cid:3)1
has no solution because y(cid:3)0(that is, y(x)(cid:3)0for all x)is the only solution of the ODE.
The initial value problem
yr (cid:3)2x, y(0)(cid:3)1
c01.qxd 7/30/10 8:15 PM Page 39
SEC. 1.7 Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions 39
has precisely one solution, namely, y(cid:3)x2(cid:4)1. The initial value problem
xyr (cid:3)y(cid:2)1, y(0)(cid:3)1
has infinitely many solutions, namely, y(cid:3)1(cid:4)cx,where c is an arbitrary constant because
y(0)(cid:3)1 for all c.
From these examples we see that an initial value problem
(1) yr (cid:3)f(x, y), y(x )(cid:3)y
0 0
may have no solution, precisely one solution, or more than one solution. This fact leads
to the following two fundamental questions.
Problem of Existence
Under what conditions does an initial value problem of the form (1) have at least
one solution (hence one or several solutions)?
Problem of Uniqueness
Under what conditions does that problem have at most one solution (hence excluding
the case that is has more than one solution)?
Theorems that state such conditions are called existence theorems and uniqueness
theorems, respectively.
Of course, for our simple examples, we need no theorems because we can solve these
examples by inspection; however, for complicated ODEs such theorems may be of
considerable practical importance. Even when you are sure that your physical or other
system behaves uniquely, occasionally your model may be oversimplified and may not
give a faithful picture of reality.
THEOREM 1 Existence Theorem
Let the right side f(x, y) of the ODE in the initial value problem
(1) yr (cid:3)f(x, y), y(x )(cid:3)y

and bounded in R; that is, there is a number K such that
(2) ƒf(x, y)ƒ (cid:11)K for all (x, y) in R.
Then the initial value problem (1)has at least one solution y(x). This solution exists
at least for all x in the subinterval ƒx(cid:2)x ƒ (cid:6) a of the interval ƒx(cid:2)x ƒ (cid:6) a;

Then the initial value problem (1)has at most one solution y(x). Thus, by Theorem1,
the problem has precisely one solution. This solution exists at least for all x in that
subinterval ƒx(cid:2)x ƒ (cid:6) a.

Understanding These Theorems
These two theorems take care of almost all practical cases. Theorem 1 says that if f(x, y)
is continuous in some region in the xy-plane containing the point (x , y ), then the initial
0 0
value problem (1) has at least one solution.
Theorem 2 says that if, moreover, the partial derivative 0f 0y of f with respect to y
>
existsand is continuous in that region, then (1) can have at most one solution; hence, by
Theorem 1, it has precisely one solution.
Read again what you have just read—these are entirely new ideas in our discussion.
Proofs of these theorems are beyond the level of this book (see Ref. [A11] in App. 1);
however, the following remarks and examples may help you to a good understanding of
the theorems.
Since yr (cid:3)f(x, y), the condition (2) implies that ƒyrƒ (cid:11)K; that is, the slope of any
solution curve y(x)in R is at least (cid:2)Kand at most K. Hence a solution curve that passes
through the point (x , y ) must lie in the colored region in Fig. 27 bounded by the lines

x between x (cid:2)aand x (cid:4)a.In the second case, shown in Fig. 27b, we have b K (cid:6) a.

Therefore, a(cid:3)b K (cid:6) a,and all we can conclude from the theorems is that the solution

curve may leave the rectangle R,and since nothing is assumed about foutside R, nothing
can be concluded about the solution for those larger or amaller x’s; that is, for such x’s
the solution may or may not exist—we don’t know.

Let us illustrate our discussion with a simple example. We shall see that our choice of
a rectangle R with a large base (a long x-interval) will lead to the case in Fig. 27b.
EXAMPLE 1 Choice of a Rectangle

yr(cid:3)1(cid:4)y2, y(0)(cid:3)0
and take the rectangle R; ƒxƒ (cid:6) 5, ƒyƒ (cid:6) 3.Then a(cid:3)5, b(cid:3)3, and

Indeed, the solution of the problem is y(cid:3)tan x(see Sec. 1.3, Example 1). This solution is discontinuous at

The conditions in the two theorems are sufficient conditions rather than necessary ones,
and can be lessened. In particular, by the mean value theorem of differential calculus we
have

It can be shown that (3b) may be replaced by the weaker condition (4), which is known
as a Lipschitz condition.9 However, continuity of f(x, y) is not enough to guarantee the
uniqueness of the solution. This may be illustrated by the following example.

although f(x, y)(cid:3) 2ƒyƒis continuous for all y.The Lipschitz condition (4) is violated in any region that includes

and this can be made as large as we please by choosing y sufficiently small, whereas (4) requires that the

quotient on the left side of (5) should not exceed a fixed constant M.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
First-Order ODEs
This chapter concerns ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of first orderand
their applications. These are equations of the form
(1) F(x, y, yr )(cid:3)0 or in explicit form yr (cid:3)f(x, y)
involving the derivative yr (cid:3)dy dx of an unknown function y, given functions of
>
x, and, perhaps, y itself. If the independent variable x is time, we denote it by t.
In Sec. 1.1 we explained the basic concepts and the process of modeling, that is,
of expressing a physical or other problem in some mathematical form and solving
it. Then we discussed the method of direction fields (Sec. 1.2), solution methods
and models (Secs. 1.3–1.6), and, finally, ideas on existence and uniqueness of
solutions (Sec. 1.7).
A first-order ODE usually has a general solution, that is, a solution involving an
arbitrary constant, which we denote by c. In applications we usually have to find a
unique solution by determining a value of c from an initial condition y(x ) (cid:3)y .

Together with the ODE this is called an initial value problem

and its solution is a particular solution of the ODE. Geometrically, a general
solution represents a family of curves, which can be graphed by using direction
fields (Sec. 1.2). And each particular solution corresponds to one of these curves.
A separable ODE is one that we can put into the form
(3) g(y) dy (cid:3)f(x) dx (Sec. 1.3)
by algebraic manipulations (possibly combined with transformations, such as
y x(cid:3)u) and solve by integrating on both sides.

Summary of Chapter 1 45
An exact ODE is of the form
(4) M(x, y) dx(cid:4)N(x, y) dy(cid:3)0 (Sec. 1.4)
where M dx(cid:4)N dy is the differential
du(cid:3)u dx(cid:4)u dy
x y
of a function u(x, y), so that from du(cid:3)0 we immediately get the implicit general
solution u(x, y)(cid:3)c.This method extends to nonexact ODEs that can be made exact
by multiplying them by some function F(x, y,),called an integrating factor(Sec. 1.4).
Linear ODEs
(5) yr (cid:4)p(x)y(cid:3)r(x)
are very important. Their solutions are given by the integral formula (4), Sec. 1.5.
Certain nonlinear ODEs can be transformed to linear form in terms of new variables.
This holds for the Bernoulli equation
yr (cid:4)p(x)y(cid:3)g(x)ya (Sec. 1.5).
Applicationsand modelingare discussed throughout the chapter, in particular in
Secs. 1.1, 1.3, 1.5 (population dynamics, etc.), and 1.6 (trajectories).
Picard’s existence and uniqueness theorems are explained in Sec. 1.7 (and
Picard’s iteration in Problem Set 1.7).
Numeric methods for first-order ODEs can be studied in Secs. 21.1 and 21.2
immediately after this chapter, as indicated in the chapter opening.

Second-Order Linear ODEs
Many important applications in mechanical and electrical engineering, as shown in Secs.
2.4, 2.8, and 2.9, are modeled by linear ordinary differential equations (linear ODEs) of the
second order. Their theory is representative of all linear ODEs as is seen when compared
to linear ODEs of third and higher order, respectively. However, the solution formulas for
second-order linear ODEs are simpler than those of higher order, so it is a natural progression
to study ODEs of second order first in this chapter and then of higher order in Chap. 3.
Although ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be grouped into linear and nonlinear
ODEs, nonlinear ODEs are difficult to solve in contrast to linear ODEs for which many
beautiful standard methods exist.
Chapter 2 includes the derivation of general and particular solutions, the latter in
connection with initial value problems.
For those interested in solution methods for Legendre’s, Bessel’s, and the hypergeometric
equations consult Chap. 5 and for Sturm–Liouville problems Chap. 11.
COMMENT. Numerics for second-order ODEs can be studied immediately after this
chapter. See Sec. 21.3, which is independent of other sections in Chaps. 19–21.

Homogeneous Linear ODEs of Second Order
We have already considered first-order linear ODEs (Sec. 1.5) and shall now define and
discuss linear ODEs of second order. These equations have important engineering
applications, especially in connection with mechanical and electrical vibrations (Secs. 2.4,
2.8, 2.9) as well as in wave motion, heat conduction, and other parts of physics, as we
shall see in Chap. 12.
A second-order ODE is called linear if it can be written
(1) ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)r(x)
and nonlinear if it cannot be written in this form.
The distinctive feature of this equation is that it is linear in y and its derivatives,whereas
the functions p, q, and r on the right may be any given functions of x. If the equation
s s
begins with, say, f(x)y ,then divide by f(x)to have the standard form(1) with y as the
first term.

SEC. 2.1 Homogeneous Linear ODEs of Second Order 47
The definitions of homogeneous and nonhomogenous second-order linear ODEs are
very similar to those of first-order ODEs discussed in Sec. 1.5. Indeed, if r(x)(cid:2)0 (that
is, r(x)(cid:3)0 for all x considered; read “r(x) is identically zero”), then (1) reduces to
(2) ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)0
and is called homogeneous. If r(x) [ 0, then (1) is called nonhomogeneous. This is
similar to Sec. 1.5.
An example of a nonhomogeneous linear ODE is
ys (cid:2)25y(cid:3)e(cid:2)x
cos x,
and a homogeneous linear ODE is
xys (cid:2)yr (cid:2)xy(cid:3)0, written in standard form ys (cid:2) 1 yr (cid:2)y(cid:3)0.
x
Finally, an example of a nonlinear ODE is
ys y(cid:2)yr2(cid:3)0.
The functions p and q in (1) and (2) are called the coefficients of the ODEs.
Solutions are defined similarly as for first-order ODEs in Chap. 1. A function
y(cid:3)h(x)
is called a solution of a (linear or nonlinear) second-order ODE on some open interval I
if h is defined and twice differentiable throughout that interval and is such that the ODE
r r
becomes an identity if we replace the unknown y by h, the derivative y by h , and the
s s
second derivative y by h . Examples are given below.
Homogeneous Linear ODEs: Superposition Principle
Sections 2.1–2.6 will be devoted to homogeneous linear ODEs (2) and the remaining
sections of the chapter to nonhomogeneous linear ODEs.
Linear ODEs have a rich solution structure. For the homogeneous equation the backbone
of this structure is the superposition principle or linearity principle, which says that we
can obtain further solutions from given ones by adding them or by multiplying them with
any constants. Of course, this is a great advantage of homogeneous linear ODEs. Let us
first discuss an example.
EXAMPLE 1 Homogeneous Linear ODEs: Superposition of Solutions
The functions y(cid:3)cos xand y(cid:3)sin xare solutions of the homogeneous linear ODE
ys(cid:2)y(cid:3)0
for all x.We verify this by differentiation and substitution. We obtain (cos
x)s(cid:3)(cid:4)cos
x; hence
ys(cid:2)y(cid:3)(cos x)s(cid:2)cos x(cid:3)(cid:4)cos x(cid:2)cos x(cid:3)0.
c02.qxd 10/27/10 6:06 PM Page 48
48 CHAP. 2 Second-Order Linear ODEs
Similarly for y(cid:3)sin x(verify!). We can go an important step further. We multiply cos xby any constant, for
instance, 4.7, and sin x by, say, (cid:4)2, and take the sum of the results, claiming that it is a solution. Indeed,
differentiation and substitution gives
(4.7 cos x(cid:4)2 sin x)s(cid:2)(4.7 cos x(cid:4)2 sin x)(cid:3)(cid:4)4.7 cos x(cid:2)2 sin x(cid:2)4.7 cos x(cid:4)2 sin x(cid:3)0. (cid:2)
In this example we have obtained from y ((cid:3) cos x)and y ((cid:3) sin x)a function of the form
1 2
(3) y(cid:3)c y (cid:2)c y (c , c arbitrary constants).
1 1 2 2 1 2
This is called a linear combination of y and y . In terms of this concept we can now
1 2
formulate the result suggested by our example, often called the superposition principle
or linearity principle.
THEOREM 1 Fundamental Theorem for the Homogeneous Linear ODE (2)
For a homogeneous linear ODE (2),any linear combination of two solutions on an
open interval I is again a solution of (2) on I. In particular, for such an equation,
sums and constant multiples of solutions are again solutions.
PROOF Let y and y be solutions of (2) on I. Then by substituting y(cid:3)c y (cid:2)c y and
1 2 1 1 2 2
its derivatives into (2), and using the familiar rule (c y (cid:2)c y )r (cid:3)c yr (cid:2)c yr , etc.,
1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2
we get
ys (cid:2)pyr (cid:2)qy(cid:3)(c y (cid:2)c y )s (cid:2)p(c y (cid:2)c y )r (cid:2)q(c y (cid:2)c y )

since in the last line, (Á )(cid:3)0because y and y are solutions, by assumption. This shows
1 2
that y is a solution of (2) on I. (cid:2)
CAUTION! Don’t forget that this highly important theorem holds for homogeneous
linear ODEs only but does not hold for nonhomogeneous linear or nonlinear ODEs, as
the following two examples illustrate.
EXAMPLE 2 A Nonhomogeneous Linear ODE
Verify by substitution that the functions y(cid:3)1(cid:2)cos xand y(cid:3)1(cid:2)sin xare solutions of the nonhomogeneous
linear ODE
ys(cid:2)y(cid:3)1,
but their sum is not a solution. Neither is, for instance, 2(1(cid:2)cos x)or 5(1(cid:2)sin x). (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 3 A Nonlinear ODE
Verify by substitution that the functions y(cid:3)x2and y(cid:3)1are solutions of the nonlinear ODE
ys y(cid:4)xyr(cid:3)0,
but their sum is not a solution. Neither is (cid:4)x2, so you cannot even multiply by (cid:4)1! (cid:2)

SEC. 2.1 Homogeneous Linear ODEs of Second Order 49
Initial Value Problem. Basis. General Solution
Recall from Chap. 1 that for a first-order ODE, an initial value problem consists of the
ODE and one initial condition y(x )(cid:3)y . The initial condition is used to determine the
0 0
arbitrary constant cin the general solutionof the ODE. This results in a unique solution,
as we need it in most applications. That solution is called a particular solution of the
ODE. These ideas extend to second-order ODEs as follows.
For a second-order homogeneous linear ODE (2) an initial value problemconsists of
(2) and two initial conditions
(4) y(x )(cid:3)K , yr (x )(cid:3)K .

These conditions prescribe given values K and K of the solution and its first derivative

of the ODE; here, y and y are suitable solutions of the ODE, with “suitable” to be
1 2
explained after the next example. This results in a unique solution, passing through the
point (x , K ) with K as the tangent direction (the slope) at that point. That solution is
0 0 1
called a particular solution of the ODE (2).

Observation. Our choice of y and y was general enough to satisfy both initial

conditions. Now let us take instead two proportional solutions y (cid:3)cos xand y (cid:3)k cos x,
1 2
so that y /y (cid:3)1/k (cid:3)const. Then we can write y(cid:3)c y (cid:2)c y in the form

y(cid:3)c cos x (cid:2)c (k cos x)(cid:3)C cos x where C(cid:3)c (cid:2)c k.

50 CHAP. 2 Second-Order Linear ODEs
Hence we are no longer able to satisfy two initial conditions with only one arbitrary
constant C. Consequently, in defining the concept of a general solution, we must exclude
proportionality. And we see at the same time why the concept of a general solution is of
importance in connection with initial value problems.
DEFINITION General Solution, Basis, Particular Solution
A general solution of an ODE (2) on an open interval I is a solution (5) in which
y and y are solutions of (2) on Ithat are not proportional, and c and c are arbitrary
1 2 1 2
constants. These y , y are called a basis (or a fundamental system) of solutions
1 2
of (2) on I.
A particular solution of (2) on I is obtained if we assign specific values to c
1
and c in (5).
2
For the definition of an intervalsee Sec. 1.1. Furthermore, as usual, y and y are called
1 2
proportional on I if for all x on I,
(6) (a) y (cid:3)ky or (b) y (cid:3)ly
1 2 2 1
where k and l are numbers, zero or not. (Note that (a) implies (b) if and only if k(cid:5)0).
Actually, we can reformulate our definition of a basis by using a concept of general
importance. Namely, two functions y and y are called linearly independent on an
1 2
interval I where they are defined if
(7) k y (x)(cid:2) k y (x) (cid:3)0 everywhere on I implies k (cid:3)0 and k (cid:3)0.
1 1 2 2 1 2
And y and y are called linearly dependent on I if (7) also holds for some constants k ,
1 2 1
k not both zero. Then, if k (cid:5)0 or k (cid:5)0, we can divide and see that y and y are
2 1 2 1 2
proportional,
k k
y (cid:3)(cid:4) 2 y or y (cid:3)(cid:4) 1 y .
1 k 2 2 k 1
1 2
In contrast, in the case of linear independencethese functions are not proportional because
then we cannot divide in (7). This gives the following
DEFINITION Basis (Reformulated)
A basis of solutions of (2) on an open interval I is a pair of linearly independent
solutions of (2) on I.
If the coefficients p and q of (2) are continuous on some open interval I, then (2) has a
general solution. It yields the unique solution of any initial value problem (2), (4). It
includes all solutions of (2) on I; hence (2) has no singular solutions (solutions not
obtainable from of a general solution; see also Problem Set 1.1). All this will be shown
in Sec. 2.6.

EXAMPLE 5 Basis, General Solution, Particular Solution
cos x and sin x in Example 4 form a basis of solutions of the ODE
ys(cid:2)y(cid:3)0
for all x because their
quotientiscot x(cid:5)const(or tan x(cid:5)const). Hence y(cid:3)c cos x(cid:2)c sin xis a general solution. The solution

proportional, ex/e(cid:2)x(cid:3) e2x(cid:5)const.Hence ex, e(cid:2)xform a basis for all x. We now write down the corresponding
general solution and its derivative and equate their values at 0 to the given initial conditions,
y(cid:3) c ex(cid:2)c e(cid:2)x, yr(cid:3)c ex(cid:4) c e(cid:2)x, y(0)(cid:3)c (cid:2)c (cid:3)6, yr (0)(cid:3)c (cid:4)c (cid:3)(cid:4)2.

Find a Basis if One Solution Is Known.
Reduction of Order
It happens quite often that one solution can be found by inspection or in some other way.
Then a second linearly independent solution can be obtained by solving a first-order ODE.
This is called the method of reduction of order.1We first show how this method works
in an example and then in general.

major work was in the calculus of variations, celestial mechanics, general mechanics (Mécanique analytique,

In this example we applied reduction of order to a homogeneous linear ODE [see (2)]

Note that we now take the ODE in standard form, with y , not f(x)y —this is essential
in applying our subsequent formulas. We assume a solution y of (2), on an open interval
1
I, to be known and want to find a basis. For this we need a second linearly independent
solution y of (2) on I. To get y , we substitute
2 2
y(cid:3)y (cid:3)uy , yr (cid:3)yr (cid:3)ur y (cid:2)uyr , ys (cid:3)ys (cid:3)us y (cid:2)2ur yr (cid:2)uys

Now comes the main point. Since y is a solution of (2), the expression in the last

this remaining ODE by y and set ur (cid:3)U, us (cid:3)Ur ,

We shall now consider second-order homogeneous linear ODEs whose coefficients aand

These equations have important applications in mechanical and electrical vibrations, as
we shall see in Secs. 2.4, 2.8, and 2.9.
To solve (1), we recall from Sec. 1.5 that the solution of the first-order linear ODE with

This gives us the idea to try as a solution of (1) the

Substituting (2) and its derivatives
yr (cid:3)lelx and ys (cid:3)l2elx
into our equation (1), we obtain

Hence if lis a solution of the important characteristic equation(or auxiliary equation)
(3) l2(cid:2)al(cid:2)b(cid:3)0
then the exponential function (2) is a solution of the ODE (1). Now from algebra we recall
that the roots of this quadratic equation (3) are

(Case II) A real double root if a2(cid:4)4b(cid:3)0,
(Case III) Complex conjugate roots if a2(cid:4)4b(cid:7)0.
Case I. Two Distinct Real-Roots l and l

In this case, a basis of solutions of (1) on any interval is
y (cid:3)el 1x and y (cid:3)el 2x
1 2
because y and y are defined (and real) for all x and their quotient is not constant. The

corresponding general solution is

EXAMPLE 1 General Solution in the Case of Distinct Real Roots
We can now solve
ys(cid:4)y(cid:3)0
in Example 6 of Sec. 2.1 systematically. The characteristic equation is
l2(cid:4)1(cid:3)0.Its roots are l (cid:3)1and l (cid:3)(cid:4)1. Hence a basis of solutions is exand e(cid:2)xand gives the same
1 2
general solution as before,
y(cid:3)c ex(cid:2)c e(cid:2)x. (cid:2)

EXAMPLE 2 Initial Value Problem in the Case of Distinct Real Roots
Solve the initial value problem
ys(cid:2)yr(cid:4)2y(cid:3)0, y(0)(cid:3)4, yr (0)(cid:3)(cid:4)5.
Solution. Step 1. General solution.The characteristic equation is
l2(cid:2)l(cid:4)2(cid:3)0.
Its roots are
l (cid:3)1((cid:4)1(cid:2) 19)(cid:3)1 and l (cid:3)1((cid:4)1(cid:4) 19)(cid:3)(cid:4)2
1 2 2 2
so that we obtain the general solution
y(cid:3)c ex(cid:2)c e(cid:2)2x.
1 2
Step 2. Particular solution.Since yr (x)(cid:3)c ex(cid:4)2c e(cid:2)2x, we obtain from the general solution and the initial
1 2
conditions
y(0)(cid:3)c (cid:2)c (cid:3)4,
1 2
yr (0)(cid:3)c (cid:4)2c (cid:3)(cid:4)5.
1 2
Hence c (cid:3)1and c (cid:3)3. This gives the answery(cid:3)ex(cid:2)3e(cid:2)2x. Figure 30 shows that the curve begins at
1 2
y(cid:3)4with a negative slope ((cid:4)5,but note that the axes have different scales!), in agreement with the initial
(cid:2)
conditions.

Case II. Real Double Root l (cid:3) (cid:4) a/2
If the discriminant a2(cid:4)4b is zero, we see directly from (4) that we get only one root,

y
(cid:3)e(cid:2)(a/2)x.

To obtain a second independent solution y (needed for a basis), we use the method of
2
reduction of order discussed in the last section, setting y (cid:3)uy . Substituting this and its
2 1
derivatives
yr (cid:3)ur
y
(cid:2)uyr
and

into (1), we first have

Collecting terms in u , u, and u, as in the last section, we obtain
us y (cid:2)ur (2yr (cid:2)ay )(cid:2)u(ys (cid:2)ayr (cid:2)by )(cid:3)0.
1 1 1 1 1 1
The expression in the last parentheses is zero, since y is a solution of (1). The expression
1
in the first parentheses is zero, too, since
2yr (cid:3)(cid:4)ae(cid:2)ax/2(cid:3)(cid:4)ay
.
1 1
We are thus left with us y (cid:3)0. Hence us (cid:3)0. By two integrations, u(cid:3)c x(cid:2)c . To
1 1 2
get a second independent solution y (cid:3)uy , we can simply choose c (cid:3)1, c (cid:3)0 and
2 1 1 2
take u(cid:3)x. Then y (cid:3)xy . Since these solutions are not proportional, they form a basis.
2 1
Hence in the case of a double root of (3) a basis of solutions of (1) on any interval is
e(cid:2)ax/2, xe(cid:2)ax/2.
The corresponding general solution is
(7) y(cid:3)(c (cid:2)c x)e(cid:2)ax/2.

EXAMPLE 3 General Solution in the Case of a Double Root
The characteristic equation of the ODE ys(cid:2)6yr(cid:2)9y(cid:3)0is l2(cid:2)6l(cid:2)9(cid:3)(l(cid:2)3)2(cid:3)0. It has the double
root l(cid:3)(cid:4)3. Hence a basis is e(cid:2)3xand xe(cid:2)3x. The corresponding general solution is y(cid:3)(c (cid:2)c x)e(cid:2)3x. (cid:2)

EXAMPLE 4 Initial Value Problem in the Case of a Double Root
Solve the initial value problem
ys(cid:2)yr(cid:2)0.25y(cid:3)0, y(0)(cid:3)3.0, yr (0) (cid:3)(cid:4)3.5.
Solution. The characteristic equation is l2(cid:2)l(cid:2)0.25(cid:3)(l(cid:2)0.5) 2(cid:3)0. It has the double root l(cid:3)(cid:4)0.5.
This gives the general solution
y(cid:3)(c (cid:2)c x)e(cid:2)0.5x.
1 2
We need its derivative
yr(cid:3)c e(cid:2)0.5x(cid:4)0.5(c (cid:2)c x)e(cid:2)0.5x.
2 1 2
From this and the initial conditions we obtain
y(0)(cid:3)c (cid:3)3.0, yr (0)(cid:3)c (cid:4)0.5c (cid:3)3.5; hence c (cid:3)(cid:4)2.

Case III. Complex Roots (cid:4)1a (cid:2) iv and (cid:4)1 a (cid:4) iv
2 2
This case occurs if the discriminant a2(cid:4)4bof the characteristic equation (3) is negative.
In this case, the roots of (3) are the complex l(cid:3)(cid:4)1a (cid:8) ivthat give the complex solutions
2
of the ODE (1). However, we will show that we can obtain a basis of real solutions
(8) y (cid:3)e(cid:2)ax/2 cos vx, y (cid:3)e(cid:2)ax/2 sin vx (v(cid:6)0)
1 2
where v2(cid:3)b(cid:4)1a2. It can be verified by substitution that these are solutions in the
4
present case. We shall derive them systematically after the two examples by using the
complex exponential function. They form a basis on any interval since their quotient
cot vx is not constant. Hence a real general solution in Case III is
(9) y(cid:3)e(cid:2)ax/2 (A cos vx(cid:2)B sin vx) (A, B arbitrary).
EXAMPLE 5 Complex Roots. Initial Value Problem
Solve the initial value problem
ys(cid:2)0.4yr(cid:2)9.04y(cid:3)0, y(0)(cid:3)0, yr (0)(cid:3)3.
Solution. Step 1. General solution.The characteristic equation is l2(cid:2)0.4l(cid:2)9.04(cid:3)0. It has the roots
(cid:4)0.2 (cid:8) 3i.Hence v(cid:3)3, and a general solution (9) is
y(cid:3)e(cid:2)0.2x (A cos 3x(cid:2)B sin 3x).
Step 2. Particular solution. The first initial condition gives y(0)(cid:3)A(cid:3)0. The remaining expression is
y(cid:3)Be(cid:2)0.2x sin 3x. We need the derivative (chain rule!)
yr(cid:3)B((cid:4)0.2e(cid:2)0.2x sin 3x(cid:2)3e(cid:2)0.2x cos 3x).
From this and the second initial condition we obtain yr (0)(cid:3)3B(cid:3)3. Hence B(cid:3)1. Our solution is
y(cid:3)e(cid:2)0.2x sin 3x.
Figure 32 shows y and the curves of e(cid:2)0.2x and (cid:4)e(cid:2)0.2x (dashed), between which the curve of y oscillates.
Such“damped vibrations” (with x(cid:3)tbeing time) have important mechanical and electrical applications, as we

It is very interesting that in applications to mechanical systems or electrical circuits,
these three cases correspond to three different forms of motion or flows of current,
respectively. We shall discuss this basic relation between theory and practice in detail in
Sec. 2.4 (and again in Sec. 2.8).
Derivation in Case III. Complex Exponential Function
If verification of the solutions in (8) satisfies you, skip the systematic derivation of these
real solutions from the complex solutions by means of the complex exponential function
ez of a complex variable z(cid:3)r(cid:2)it. We write r(cid:2)it, not x(cid:2)iy because x and y occur
in the ODE. The definition of ez in terms of the real functions er, cos t, and sin t is
(10) ez(cid:3)er(cid:2)it(cid:3)ereit(cid:3)er(cos t (cid:2)i sin t).
This is motivated as follows. For real z(cid:3)r, hence t(cid:3)0, cos 0 (cid:3)1, sin 0 (cid:3)0, we get
the real exponential function er. It can be shown that ez1(cid:2)z2(cid:3)ez1ez2, just as in real. (Proof
in Sec. 13.5.) Finally, if we use the Maclaurin series of ez with z(cid:3)it as well as
i2(cid:3)(cid:4)1, i3(cid:3)(cid:4)i, i4(cid:3)1, etc., and reorder the terms as shown (this is permissible, as
can be proved), we obtain the series

(Look up these real series in your calculus book if necessary.) We see that we have obtained
the formula

called the Euler formula. Multiplication by er gives (10).

SEC. 2.2 Homogeneous Linear ODEs with Constant Coefficients 59
For later use we note that e(cid:2)it(cid:3)cos ((cid:4)t)(cid:2)i sin ((cid:4)t)(cid:3)cos t (cid:4)i sin t, so that by
addition and subtraction of this and (11),

After these comments on the definition (10), let us now turn to Case III.
In Case III the radicand a2(cid:4)4b in (4) is negative. Hence 4b(cid:4)a2 is positive and,
using 1(cid:4)1(cid:3)i, we obtain in (4)
12a2(cid:4)4b(cid:3)12(cid:4)(4b (cid:4)a2)(cid:3) 2(cid:4)(b(cid:4)1a2)(cid:3)i2b (cid:4)1a2(cid:3)iv

with v defined as in (8). Hence in (4),
l (cid:3)1a(cid:2)iv and, similarly, l (cid:3)1a(cid:4)iv.
1 2 2 2
Using (10) with r(cid:3)(cid:4)1axand t(cid:3)vx, we thus obtain
2
el 1x(cid:3)e(cid:2)(a/2)x(cid:2)ivx(cid:3)e(cid:2)(a/2)x(cos vx (cid:2)i sin vx)
el 2x(cid:3)e(cid:2)(a/2)x(cid:4)ivx(cid:3)e(cid:2)(a/2)x(cos vx (cid:4)i sin vx).
We now add these two lines and multiply the result by 1. This gives y as in (8). Then
2 1
we subtract the second line from the first and multiply the result by 1/(2i). This gives y
2
as in (8). These results obtained by addition and multiplication by constants are again
solutions, as follows from the superposition principle in Sec. 2.1. This concludes the
derivation of these real solutions in Case III.

Differential Operators. Optional
This short section can be omitted without interrupting the flow of ideas. It will not be
used subsequently, except for the notations Dy, D2 y, etc. to stand for yr , ys , etc.
Operational calculus means the technique and application of operators. Here, an
operator is a transformation that transforms a function into another function. Hence
differential calculus involves an operator, the differential operator D, which
transforms a (differentiable) function into its derivative. In operator notation we write
D(cid:3) d and
dx
dy
(1) Dy(cid:3)yr (cid:3) .
dx
Similarly, for the higher derivatives we write D2y(cid:3)D(Dy) (cid:3)ys , and so on. For example,
D sin (cid:3)cos, D2 sin (cid:3)(cid:4)sin, etc.
For a homogeneous linear ODE ys (cid:2)ayr (cid:2)by(cid:3)0with constant coefficients we can
now introduce the second-order differential operator
L(cid:3)P(D)(cid:3)D2(cid:2)aD(cid:2)bI,
where I is the identity operator defined by Iy(cid:3)y. Then we can write that ODE as
(2) Ly(cid:3)P(D)y(cid:3)(D2(cid:2)aD(cid:2)bI)y(cid:3)0.
c02.qxd 10/27/10 6:06 PM Page 61
SEC. 2.3 Differential Operators. Optional 61
P suggests “polynomial.” L is a linear operator. By definition this means that if Ly and
Lw exist (this is the case if y and w are twice differentiable), then L(cy(cid:2)kw) exists for
any constants c and k, and
L(cy(cid:2)kw)(cid:3)cLy(cid:2)kLw.
Let us show that from (2) we reach agreement with the results in Sec. 2.2. Since
(Del)(x)(cid:3)lelx and (D2el)(x)(cid:3)l2elx, we obtain
Lel(x)(cid:3)P(D)el(x)(cid:3)(D2(cid:2)aD(cid:2)bI)el(x)
(3)
(cid:3)(l2(cid:2)al(cid:2)b)elx(cid:3)P(l)elx(cid:3)0.
This confirms our result of Sec. 2.2 that elx is a solution of the ODE (2) if and only if l
is a solution of the characteristic equation P(l)(cid:3)0.
P(l) is a polynomial in the usual sense of algebra. If we replace l by the operator D,
we obtain the “operator polynomial” P(D). The point of this operational calculus is that
P(D) can be treated just like an algebraic quantity. In particular, we can factor it.
EXAMPLE 1 Factorization, Solution of an ODE
Factor P(D)(cid:3)D2(cid:4)3D(cid:4)40Iand solve P(D)y(cid:3)0.
Solution. D2(cid:4)3D(cid:4)40I(cid:3)(D(cid:4)8I)(D(cid:2)5I) because I2(cid:3)I. Now (D(cid:4)8I)y(cid:3)yr(cid:4)8y(cid:3)0 has the
solution y (cid:3)e8x. Similarly, the solution of (D(cid:2)5I)y(cid:3)0is y (cid:3)e(cid:2)5x. This is a basis of P(D)y(cid:3)0on any
1 2
interval. From the factorization we obtain the ODE, as expected,
(D(cid:4)8I)(D(cid:2)5I)y(cid:3)(D(cid:4)8I)(yr(cid:2)5y)(cid:3)D(yr(cid:2)5y)(cid:4)8(yr(cid:2)5y)
(cid:3)ys(cid:2)5yr(cid:4)8yr(cid:4)40y(cid:3)ys(cid:4)3r(cid:4)40y(cid:3)0.
Verify that this agrees with the result of our method in Sec. 2.2. This is not unexpected because we factored
P(D)in the same way as the characteristic polynomial P(l)(cid:3)l2(cid:4)3l(cid:4)40. (cid:2)
It was essential that L in (2) had constant coefficients. Extension of operator methods to
variable-coefficient ODEs is more difficult and will not be considered here.
If operational methods were limited to the simple situations illustrated in this section,
it would perhaps not be worth mentioning. Actually, the power of the operator approach
appears in more complicated engineering problems, as we shall see in Chap. 6.

Modeling of Free Oscillations
of a Mass–Spring System
Linear ODEs with constant coefficients have important applications in mechanics, as we
show in this section as well as in Sec. 2.8, and in electrical circuits as we show in Sec. 2.9.
In this section we model and solve a basic mechanical system consisting of a mass on an
elastic spring (a so-called “mass–spring system,” Fig. 33), which moves up and down.
Setting Up the Model
We take an ordinary coil spring that resists extension as well as compression. We suspend
it vertically from a fixed support and attach a body at its lower end, for instance, an iron
ball, as shown in Fig. 33. We let y(cid:3)0 denote the position of the ball when the system
is at rest (Fig. 33b). Furthermore, we choose the downward direction as positive, thus
regarding downward forces as positive and upward forces as negative.

We now let the ball move, as follows. We pull it down by an amount y(cid:6)0(Fig. 33c).
This causes a spring force
(1) F (cid:3)(cid:4)ky (Hooke’s law2)
1
proportional to the stretch y, with k ((cid:6)0) called the spring constant. The minus sign
indicates that F points upward, against the displacement. It is a restoring force: It wants
1
to restore the system, that is, to pull it back to y(cid:3)0. Stiff springs have large k.

ODE of the Undamped System
Every system has damping. Otherwise it would keep moving forever. But if the damping
is small and the motion of the system is considered over a relatively short time, we
may disregard damping. Then Newton’s law with F (cid:3)(cid:4)F gives the model

EXAMPLE 1 Harmonic Oscillation of an Undamped Mass–Spring System
If a mass–spring system with an iron ball of weight W(cid:3)98nt (about 22 lb) can be regarded as undamped, and
the spring is such that the ball stretches it 1.09 m (about 43 in.), how many cycles per minute will the system
execute? What will its motion be if we pull the ball down from rest by 16 cm (about 6 in.) and let it start with
zero initial velocity?
Solution. Hooke’s law (1) with W as the force and 1.09 meter as the stretch gives W(cid:3)1.09k; thus
k(cid:3)W 1.09(cid:3) 98 1.09(cid:3)90 [kg sec2](cid:3)90 [nt meter]. The mass is m(cid:3)W g(cid:3)98 9.8(cid:3)10 [kg]. This

the good agreement between theory and experiment, usually within a fraction of one percent if you measure

SEC. 2.4 Modeling of Free Oscillations of a Mass–Spring System 65
The constant c is called the damping constant. Let us show that c is positive. Indeed,
the damping force F
(cid:3)(cid:4)cyr
acts againstthe motion; hence for a downward motion we
2
have yr (cid:6)0 which for positive c makes F negative (an upward force), as it should be.
Similarly, for an upward motion we have yr (cid:7)0 which, for c(cid:6)0 makes F positive (a
2
downward force).
The ODE (5) is homogeneous linear and has constant coefficients. Hence we can solve
it by the method in Sec. 2.2. The characteristic equation is (divide (5) by m)

It is now interesting that depending on the amount of damping present—whether a lot of
damping, a medium amount of damping or little damping—three types of motions occur,
respectively:
Case I. c2(cid:6)4mk. Distinct real roots l , l . (Overdamping)
1 2
Case II. c2(cid:3)4mk. A real double root. (Critical damping)
Case III. c2(cid:7)4mk. Complex conjugate roots. (Underdamping)
They correspond to the three Cases I, II, III in Sec. 2.2.
Discussion of the Three Cases
Case I. Overdamping
If the damping constant cis so large that c2(cid:6)4mk, then l and l are distinct real roots.
1 2
In this case the corresponding general solution of (5) is
(7) y(t)(cid:3)c e(cid:2)(a(cid:2)b)t(cid:2)c e(cid:2)(a(cid:3)b)t.
1 2
We see that in this case, damping takes out energy so quickly that the body does not
oscillate. For t(cid:6)0 both exponents in (7) are negative because a(cid:6)0, b(cid:6)0, and
b2(cid:3)a2(cid:4)k m(cid:7)a2. Hence both terms in (7) approach zero as t:(cid:11). Practically

speaking, after a sufficiently long time the mass will be at rest at the static equilibrium
position (y(cid:3)0). Figure 37 shows (7) for some typical initial conditions.

Case II. Critical Damping
Critical damping is the border case between nonoscillatory motions (Case I) and oscillations
(Case III). It occurs if the characteristic equation has a double root, that is, if c2(cid:3)4mk,
so that b(cid:3)0, l (cid:3)l (cid:3)(cid:4)a. Then the corresponding general solution of (5) is

(8) y(t)(cid:3)(c (cid:2)c t)e(cid:2)at.

This solution can pass through the equilibrium position y(cid:3)0at most once because e(cid:2)at
is never zero and c (cid:2)c tcan have at most one positive zero. If both c and c are positive
1 2 1 2
(or both negative), it has no positive zero, so that ydoes not pass through 0 at all. Figure38
shows typical forms of (8). Note that they look almost like those in the previous figure.

Case III. Underdamping
This is the most interesting case. It occurs if the damping constant c is so small that
c2(cid:7)4mk. Then b in (6) is no longer real but pure imaginary, say,

(We now write v*to reserve vfor driving and electromotive forces in Secs. 2.8 and 2.9.)
The roots of the characteristic equation are now complex conjugates,
l (cid:3)(cid:4)a(cid:2)iv*, l (cid:3)(cid:4)a(cid:4)iv*
1 2
with a(cid:3)c (2m), as given in (6). Hence the corresponding general solution is

This represents damped oscillations. Their curve lies between the dashed curves

of p because these are the points at which cos (v*t (cid:4)d) equals 1 or (cid:4)1.
The frequency is v* (2p) Hz (hertz, cycles/sec). From (9) we see that the smaller

c ((cid:6)0)is, the larger is v*and the more rapid the oscillations become. If capproaches 0,
then v* approaches v (cid:3) 2k m, giving the harmonic oscillation (4), whose frequency

EXAMPLE 2 The Three Cases of Damped Motion
How does the motion in Example 1 change if we change the damping constant cfrom one to another of the
following three values, with y(0)(cid:3)0.16 and yr (0)(cid:3)0as before?
(I) c(cid:3)100 kg sec, (II) c(cid:3)60 kg sec, (III) c(cid:3)10 kg sec.

Solution. It is interesting to see how the behavior of the system changes due to the effect of the damping,
which takes energy from the system, so that the oscillations decrease in amplitude (Case III) or even disappear
(Cases II and I).
(I)With m(cid:3)10 and k(cid:3)90, as in Example 1, the model is the initial value problem
10ys(cid:2)100yr(cid:2)90y(cid:3)0, y(0)(cid:3)0.16 [meter], yr (0)(cid:3)0.
c02.qxd 10/27/10 6:06 PM Page 68
68 CHAP. 2 Second-Order Linear ODEs
The characteristic equation is 10l2(cid:2)100l(cid:2)90(cid:3)10(l(cid:2)9)(l(cid:2)1)(cid:3)0. It has the roots (cid:4)9and (cid:4)1. This
gives the general solution
y(cid:3)c e(cid:2)9t(cid:2)c e(cid:2)t. We also need yr(cid:3)(cid:4)9c e(cid:2)9t(cid:4)c e(cid:2)t.
1 2 1 2
The initial conditions give c (cid:2)c (cid:3)0.16, (cid:4)9c (cid:4)c (cid:3)0. The solution is c (cid:3)(cid:4)0.02, c (cid:3)0.18. Hence in
1 2 1 2 1 2
the overdamped case the solution is
y(cid:3)(cid:4)0.02e(cid:2)9t(cid:2)0.18e(cid:2)t.
It approaches 0 as t:(cid:11). The approach is rapid; after a few seconds the solution is practically 0, that is, the
iron ball is at rest.
(II) The model is as before, with c(cid:3)60 instead of 100. The characteristic equation now has the form
10l2(cid:2)60l(cid:2)90(cid:3)10(l(cid:2)3) 2(cid:3)0. It has the double root (cid:4)3. Hence the corresponding general solution is
y(cid:3)(c (cid:2)c t)e(cid:2)3t. We also need yr(cid:3)(c (cid:4)3c (cid:4)3c t)e(cid:2)3t.
1 2 2 1 2
The initial conditions give y(0)(cid:3)c (cid:3)0.16, yr (0)(cid:3)c (cid:4)3c (cid:3)0, c (cid:3)0.48. Hence in the critical case the
1 2 1 2
solution is
y(cid:3)(0.16(cid:2)0.48t)e(cid:2)3t.
It is always positive and decreases to 0 in a monotone fashion.
(III)The model now is 10ys(cid:2)10yr(cid:2)90y(cid:3)0. Since c(cid:3)10is smaller than the critical c, we shall get
oscillations. The characteristic equation is 10l2(cid:2)10l(cid:2)90(cid:3)10[(l(cid:2)1) 2(cid:2)9(cid:4)1](cid:3)0. It has the complex
2 4
roots [see (4) in Sec. 2.2 with a(cid:3)1and b(cid:3)9]
l(cid:3)(cid:4)0.5 (cid:8) 20.52(cid:4)9(cid:3)(cid:4)0.5 (cid:8) 2.96i.
This gives the general solution
y(cid:3)e(cid:2)0.5t(A cos 2.96t(cid:2)B sin 2.96t).
Thus y(0)(cid:3)A(cid:3)0.16. We also need the derivative
yr(cid:3)e(cid:2)0.5t((cid:4)0.5A cos 2.96t(cid:4)0.5B sin 2.96t(cid:4)2.96A sin 2.96t(cid:2)2.96B cos 2.96t).
Hence yr (0) (cid:3)(cid:4)0.5A(cid:2)2.96B(cid:3)0, B(cid:3)0.5A 2.96(cid:3)0.027. This gives the solution

y(cid:3)e(cid:2)0.5t(0.16 cos 2.96t(cid:2)0.027 sin 2.96t)(cid:3)0.162e(cid:2)0.5t cos (2.96t(cid:4)0.17).
We see that these damped oscillations have a smaller frequency than the harmonic oscillations in Example 1 by
(cid:2)
about 1%(since 2.96 is smaller than 3.00 by about 1%). Their amplitude goes to zero. See Fig. 40.

Euler–Cauchy Equations
Euler–Cauchy equations4 are ODEs of the form
(1) x2ys (cid:2)axyr (cid:2)by(cid:3)0
with given constants a and b and unknown function y(x). We substitute
y(cid:3)xm, yr (cid:3)mxm(cid:2)1, ys (cid:3)m(m(cid:4)1)xm(cid:2)2
into (1). This gives
x2m(m(cid:4)1)xm(cid:4)2(cid:2)axmxm(cid:4)1(cid:2)bxm(cid:3)0
and we now see that y(cid:3)xmwas a rather natural choice because we have obtained a com-
mon factor xm. Dropping it, we have the auxiliary equation m(m(cid:4)1)(cid:2)am(cid:2)b(cid:3)0or
(2) m2(cid:2)(a(cid:4)1)m(cid:2)b(cid:3)0. (Note: a(cid:4)1, not a.)
Hence y(cid:3)xm is a solution of (1) if and only if m is a root of (2). The roots of (2) are
(3) m (cid:3)1(1 (cid:4)a)(cid:2) 21(1 (cid:4)a)2(cid:4)b, m (cid:3)1(1 (cid:4)a)(cid:4) 21(1 (cid:4)a)2(cid:4)b.

Case III. Complex conjugate rootsare of minor practical importance, and we discuss
the derivation of real solutions from complex ones just in terms of a typical example.
EXAMPLE 3 Real General Solution in the Case of Complex Roots
The Euler–Cauchy equation x2ys(cid:2)0.6xyr(cid:2)16.04y(cid:3)0has the auxiliary equation m2(cid:4)0.4m(cid:2)16.04(cid:3)0.
The roots are complex conjugate, m (cid:3)0.2(cid:2)4iand m (cid:3)0.2(cid:4)4i, where i(cid:3) 1(cid:4)1. We now use the trick
1 2
of writing x(cid:3)eln xand obtain
xm1(cid:3)x0.2(cid:2)4i(cid:3)x0.2(eln x)4i(cid:3)x0.2e(4 ln x)i,
xm2(cid:3)x0.2(cid:2)4i(cid:3)x0.2(eln x)(cid:2)4i(cid:3)x0.2e(cid:2)(4 ln x)i.
Next we apply Euler’s formula (11) in Sec. 2.2 with t(cid:3)4lnx to these two formulas. This gives
xm1(cid:3)x0.2[cos (4 ln x)(cid:2)i sin (4 ln x)],
xm2(cid:3)x0.2[cos (4 ln x)(cid:4)i sin (4 ln x)].
We now add these two formulas, so that the sine drops out, and divide the result by 2. Then we subtract the
second formula from the first, so that the cosine drops out, and divide the result by 2i. This yields
x0.2 cos (4 ln x) and x0.2 sin (4 ln x)
respectively. By the superposition principle in Sec. 2.2 these are solutions of the Euler–Cauchy equation (1).
Since their quotient cot (4 ln x)is not constant, they are linearly independent. Hence they form a basis of solutions,
and the corresponding real general solution for all positive xis
(8) y (cid:3)x0.2[A cos (4 ln x)(cid:2)B sin (4 ln x)].

Existence and Uniqueness
of Solutions. Wronskian
In this section we shall discuss the general theory of homogeneous linear ODEs
(1) ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)0
with continuous, but otherwise arbitrary, variable coefficientspand q. This will concern
the existence and form of a general solution of (1) as well as the uniqueness of the solution
of initial value problems consisting of such an ODE and two initial conditions
(2) y(x )(cid:3)K , yr (x )(cid:3)K
0 0 0 1
with given x , K , and K .
0 0 1
The two main results will be Theorem 1, stating that such an initial value problem
always has a solution which is unique, and Theorem 4, stating that a general solution
(3) y(cid:3)c y (cid:2)c y (c , c arbitrary)
1 1 2 2 1 2
includes all solutions. Hence linearODEs with continuous coefficients have no “singular
solutions” (solutions not obtainable from a general solution).
Clearly, no such theory was needed for constant-coefficient or Euler–Cauchy equations
because everything resulted explicitly from our calculations.
Central to our present discussion is the following theorem.
THEOREM 1 Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for Initial Value Problems
If p(x)and q(x)are continuous functions on some open interval I (see Sec. 1.1)and
x is in I, then the initial value problem consisting of (1) and (2) has a unique
0
solution y(x) on the interval I.
c02.qxd 10/27/10 6:06 PM Page 75
SEC. 2.6 Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions. Wronskian 75
The proof of existence uses the same prerequisites as the existence proof in Sec. 1.7
and will not be presented here; it can be found in Ref. [A11] listed in App. 1. Uniqueness
proofs are usually simpler than existence proofs. But for Theorem 1, even the uniqueness
proof is long, and we give it as an additional proof in App. 4.
Linear Independence of Solutions
Remember from Sec. 2.1 that a general solution on an open interval I is made up from a
basis y , y on I, that is, from a pair of linearly independent solutions on I. Here we call
1 2
y , y linearly independent on I if the equation
1 2
(4) k y (x) (cid:2)k y (x)(cid:3)0 on I implies k (cid:3)0, k (cid:3)0.
1 1 2 2 1 2
We call y , y linearly dependent on I if this equation also holds for constants k , k
1 2 1 2
not both 0. In this case, and only in this case, y and y are proportional on I, that is (see
1 2
Sec. 2.1),
(5) (a) y (cid:3)ky or (b) y (cid:3)ly for all on I.
1 2 2 1
For our discussion the following criterion of linear independence and dependence of
solutions will be helpful.
THEOREM 2 Linear Dependence and Independence of Solutions
Let the ODE (1) have continuous coefficients p(x) and q(x) on an open interval I.
Then two solutions y and y of (1) on I are linearly dependent on I if and only if
1 2
their “Wronskian”
(6) W(y , y )(cid:3)y yr (cid:4) y yr
1 2 1 2 2 1
is 0 at some x in I. Furthermore, if W(cid:3)0 at an x(cid:3)x in I, then W(cid:3)0 on I;
0 0
hence, if there is an x in I at which W is not 0, then y , y are linearly independent
1 1 2
on I.
PROOF (a) Let y and y be linearly dependent on I. Then (5a) or (5b) holds on I. If (5a) holds,
1 2
then
W(y , y )(cid:3)y yr (cid:4)y yr (cid:3)ky yr (cid:4)y kyr (cid:3)0.
1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2
Similarly if (5b) holds.
(b) Conversely, we let W(y , y )(cid:3)0for some x(cid:3)x and show that this implies linear
1 2 0
dependence of y and y on I. We consider the linear system of equations in the unknowns

To eliminate k , multiply the first equation by yr and the second by (cid:4)y and add the
2 2 2
resulting equations. This gives
k y (x )yr (x )(cid:4) k yr (x )y (x )(cid:3) k W(y (x ), y (x )) (cid:3)0.
1 1 0 2 0 1 1 0 2 0 1 1 0 2 0
Similarly, to eliminate k , multiply the first equation by
(cid:4)yr
and the second by y and
1 1 1
add the resulting equations. This gives
k W(y (x ), y (x )) (cid:3)0.
2 1 0 2 0
If Wwere not 0 at x , we could divide by Wand conclude that k (cid:3)k (cid:3)0. Since Wis
0 1 2
0, division is not possible, and the system has a solution for which k and k are not both
1 2
0. Using these numbers k , k , we introduce the function
1 2
y(x)(cid:3)k y (x) (cid:2)k y (x).
1 1 2 2
Since (1) is homogeneous linear, Fundamental Theorem 1 in Sec. 2.1 (the superposition
principle) implies that this function is a solution of (1) on I. From (7) we see that it satisfies
the initial conditions y(x )(cid:3)0, yr (x )(cid:3)0. Now another solution of (1) satisfying the
0 0
same initial conditions is y*(cid:2)0. Since the coefficients p and q of (1) are continuous,
Theorem 1 applies and gives uniqueness, that is, y(cid:2)y*, written out
k y (cid:2)k y (cid:2)0 on I.
1 1 2 2
Now since k and k are not both zero, this means linear dependence of y , y on I.
1 2 1 2
(c) We prove the last statement of the theorem. If W(x )(cid:3)0 at an x in I, we have
0 0
linear dependence of y , y on Iby part (b), hence W(cid:2)0by part (a) of this proof. Hence
1 2
in the case of linear dependence it cannot happen that W(x )(cid:5)0 at an x in I. If it does
1 1
happen, it thus implies linear independence as claimed. (cid:2)
For calculations, the following formulas are often simpler than (6).

solutions y and y of (1), as has already been mentioned in (6). Note that its four entries

occupy the same positions as in the linear system (7).

existence.
THEOREM 3 Existence of a General Solution

on I.

We finally show that a general solution is as general as it can possibly be.
THEOREM 4 A General Solution Includes All Solutions
If the ODE (1) has continuous coefficients p(x) and q(x) on some open interval I,
then every solution y(cid:3)Y(x) of (1) on I is of the form
(8) Y(x) (cid:3)C y (x) (cid:2)C y (x)
1 1 2 2
where y , y is any basis of solutions of (1)on I and C , C are suitable constants.
1 2 1 2
Hence (1)does not have singular solutions(that is, solutions not obtainable from
a general solution).
PROOF Let y(cid:3)Y(x) be any solution of (1) on I. Now, by Theorem 3 the ODE (1) has a general
solution
(9) y(x)(cid:3)c y (x) (cid:2)c y (x)

multiply (10a) by

Since y , y is a basis, the Wronskian W in these equations is not 0, and we can solve for

obtain from (9) the particular solution

From the uniqueness stated in Theorem 1 this implies that y* and Y must be equal

SEC. 2.7 Nonhomogeneous ODEs 79
Reflecting on this section, we note that homogeneous linear ODEs with continuous variable
coefficients have a conceptually and structurally rather transparent existence and uniqueness
theory of solutions. Important in itself, this theory will also provide the foundation for our
study of nonhomogeneous linear ODEs, whose theory and engineering applications form
the content of the remaining four sections of this chapter.

Nonhomogeneous ODEs
We now advance from homogeneous to nonhomogeneous linear ODEs.
Consider the second-order nonhomogeneous linear ODE
(1) ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)r(x)
where r(x) [ 0. We shall see that a “general solution” of (1) is the sum of a general
solution of the corresponding homogeneous ODE

(2) ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)0
and a “particular solution” of (1). These two new terms “general solution of (1)” and
“particular solution of (1)” are defined as follows.
DEFINITION General Solution, Particular Solution
A general solution of the nonhomogeneous ODE (1) on an open interval I is a
solution of the form
(3) y(x)(cid:3)y (x)(cid:2)y x ;
h p1 2
here, y (cid:3)c y (cid:2)c y is a general solution of the homogeneous ODE (2) on Iand
h 1 1 2 2
y is any solution of (1) on I containing no arbitrary constants.
p
A particular solution of (1) on I is a solution obtained from (3) by assigning
specific values to the arbitrary constants c and c in y .
1 2 h
Our task is now twofold, first to justify these definitions and then to develop a method
for finding a solution y of (1).
p
Accordingly, we first show that a general solution as just defined satisfies (1)and that
the solutions of (1) and (2) are related in a very simple way.
THEOREM 1 Relations of Solutions of (1) to Those of (2)
~
(a) The sum of a solution y of (1) on some open interval I and a solution y of
(2) on I is a solution of (1) on I. In particular, (3) is a solution of (1) on I.
(b) The difference of two solutions of (1) on I is a solution of (2) on I.
~
PROOF (a) Let L[y]denote the left side of (1). Then for any solutions yof (1) and y of (2) on I,
L[y(cid:2)~ y](cid:3)L[y](cid:2)L[~ y](cid:3)r(cid:2)0(cid:3)r.

r(cid:4)r(cid:3)0. (cid:2)
Now for homogeneous ODEs (2) we know that general solutions include all solutions.
We show that the same is true for nonhomogeneous ODEs (1).
THEOREM 2 A General Solution of a Nonhomogeneous ODE Includes All Solutions
If the coefficients p(x), q(x), and the function r(x) in (1) are continuous on some
open interval I, then every solution of (1) on I is obtained by assigning suitable
values to the arbitrary constants c and c in a general solution (3) of (1) on I.

PROOF Let y* be any solution of (1) on I and x any x in I. Let (3) be any general solution of

(1) on I. This solution exists. Indeed, y (cid:3)c y (cid:2)c y exists by Theorem 3 in Sec. 2.6

Theorem 1 in Sec. 2.6 implies that for these conditions, as for any other initial conditions
in I, there exists a unique particular solution of (2) obtained by assigning suitable values
to c , c in y . From this and y*(cid:3)Y(cid:2)y the statement follows. (cid:2)

Method of Undetermined Coefficients
Our discussion suggests the following. To solve the nonhomogeneous ODE(1) or an initial
value problem for(1), we have to solve the homogeneous ODE(2) and find any solution
y of (1), so that we obtain a general solution (3) of (1).
p
How can we find a solution y of (1)? One method is the so-called method of
p
undetermined coefficients. It is much simpler than another, more general, method (given
in Sec. 2.10). Since it applies to models of vibrational systems and electric circuits to be
shown in the next two sections, it is frequently used in engineering.
More precisely, the method of undetermined coefficients is suitable for linear ODEs
with constant coefficients a and b
(4) ys (cid:2)ayr (cid:2)by(cid:3)r(x)
when r(x)is an exponential function, a power of x, a cosine or sine, or sums or products
of such functions. These functions have derivatives similar to r(x) itself. This gives the
idea. We choose a form for y similar to r(x), but with unknown coefficients to be
p
determined by substituting that y and its derivatives into the ODE. Table 2.1 on p. 82
p
shows the choice of y for practically important forms of r(x). Corresponding rules are
p
as follows.
Choice Rules for the Method of Undetermined Coefficients
(a) Basic Rule. If r(x)in (4) is one of the functions in the first column in
Table 2.1, choose y in the same line and determine its undetermined
p
coefficients by substituting y and its derivatives into (4).
p
(b) Modification Rule. If a term in your choice for y happens to be a
p
solution of the homogeneous ODE corresponding to (4), multiply this term
by x (or by x2 if this solution corresponds to a double root of the
characteristic equation of the homogeneous ODE).
(c) Sum Rule. If r(x)is a sum of functions in the first column of Table 2.1,
choose for y the sum of the functions in the corresponding lines of the
p
second column.
The Basic Rule applies when r(x)is a single term. The Modification Rule helps in the
indicated case, and to recognize such a case, we have to solve the homogeneous ODE
first. The Sum Rule follows by noting that the sum of two solutions of (1) with r(cid:3)r
1
and r(cid:3)r (and the same left side!) is a solution of (1) with r(cid:3)r (cid:2)r . (Verify!)
2 1 2
c02.qxd 10/27/10 6:06 PM Page 82
82 CHAP. 2 Second-Order Linear ODEs
The method is self-correcting. A false choice for y or one with too few terms will lead
p
to a contradiction. A choice with too many terms will give a correct result, with superfluous
coefficients coming out zero.
Let us illustrate Rules (a)–(c) by the typical Examples 1–3.

on both sides; thus K(cid:3)0.001and 2K(cid:3)0,a contradiction.
The second line in Table 2.1 suggests the choice
y (cid:3)K x2(cid:2)K x(cid:2)K . Then ys(cid:2)y (cid:3)2K (cid:2)K x2(cid:2)K x(cid:2)K (cid:3)0.001x2.
p 2 1 0 p p 2 2 1 0
Equating the coefficients of x2, x, x0 on both sides, we have K (cid:3)0.001, K (cid:3)0, 2K (cid:2)K (cid:3)0. Hence
2 1 2 0
K (cid:3)(cid:4)2K (cid:3)(cid:4)0.002.This gives y (cid:3)0.001x2(cid:4)0.002,and

ODE is l2(cid:2)3l(cid:2)2.25(cid:3)(l(cid:2)1.5)2(cid:3)0.Hence the homogeneous ODE has the general solution

Step 2. Solution y of the nonhomogeneous ODE.The function e(cid:2)1.5xon the right would normally require
p
the choice Ce(cid:2)1.5x. But we see from y that this function is a solution of the homogeneous ODE, which
h
corresponds to a double root of the characteristic equation. Hence, according to the Modification Rule we have
to multiply our choice function by x2. That is, we choose
y (cid:3)Cx2e(cid:2)1.5x. Then yr (cid:3)C(2x(cid:4)1.5x2)e(cid:2)1.5x, ys(cid:3)C(2(cid:4)3x(cid:4)3x(cid:2)2.25x2)e(cid:2)1.5x.

We substitute these expressions into the given ODE and omit the factor e(cid:2)1.5x. This yields

Comparing the coefficients of x2, x, x0gives 0(cid:3)0, 0(cid:3)0, 2C(cid:3)(cid:4)10,hence C(cid:3)(cid:4)5.This gives the solution

Stability. The following is important. If (and only if) all the roots of the characteristic
equation of the homogeneous ODE ys (cid:2)ayr (cid:2)by(cid:3)0in (4) are negative, or have a negative
real part, then a general solution y of this ODE goes to 0 as x:(cid:11), so that the “transient

nonhomogeneous ODE and the physical or other system modeled by the ODE are called

Modeling: Forced Oscillations. Resonance
In Sec. 2.4 we considered vertical motions of a mass–spring system (vibration of a mass
m on an elastic spring, as in Figs. 33 and 53) and modeled it by the homogeneouslinear
ODE
(1) mys (cid:2)cyr (cid:2)ky(cid:3)0.
Here y(t) as a function of time t is the displacement of the body of mass m from rest.
The mass–spring system of Sec. 2.4 exhibited only free motion. This means no external
forces (outside forces) but only internal forces controlled the motion. The internal forces
s r
are forces within the system. They are the force of inertia my , the damping force cy
(if c(cid:6)0), and the spring force ky, a restoring force.

We now extend our model by including an additional force, that is, the external force
r(t), on the right. Then we have
(2*) mys (cid:2)cyr (cid:2)ky(cid:3)r(t).
Mechanically this means that at each instant t the resultant of the internal forces is in
equilibrium with r(t).The resulting motion is called a forced motionwith forcing function
r(t), which is also known as input or driving force, and the solution y(t) to be obtained
is called the output or the response of the system to the driving force.
Of special interest are periodic external forces, and we shall consider a driving force
of the form
r(t)(cid:3)F cos vt (F (cid:6)0, v(cid:6)0).
0 0
Then we have the nonhomogeneous ODE
(2) mys (cid:2)cyr (cid:2)ky(cid:3)F cos vt.

Its solution will reveal facts that are fundamental in engineering mathematics and allow
us to model resonance.
Solving the Nonhomogeneous ODE (2)
From Sec. 2.7 we know that a general solution of (2) is the sum of a general solution y
h
of the homogeneous ODE (1) plus any solution y of (2). To find y ,we use the method
p p
of undetermined coefficients (Sec. 2.7), starting from
(3) y (t)(cid:3)a cos vt (cid:2)b sin vt.
p
By differentiating this function (chain rule!) we obtain
yr (cid:3)(cid:4)va sin vt (cid:2)vb cos vt,
p
ys (cid:3)(cid:4)v2a cos vt (cid:4)v2b sin vt.

Substituting y , y , and y into (2) and collecting the cosine and the sine terms, we get

0
The cosine terms on both sides must be equal, and the coefficient of the sine term
on the left must be zero since there is no sine term on the right. This gives the two
equations

for determining the unknown coefficients a and b. This is a linear system. We can solve
it by elimination. To eliminate b, multiply the first equation by k(cid:4)mv2 and the second
by (cid:4)vc and add the results, obtaining
(k(cid:4)mv2)2a(cid:2)v2c2a(cid:3)F (k(cid:4)mv2).

Similarly, to eliminate a, multiply (the first equation by vc and the second by k(cid:4)mv2
and add to get
v2c2b(cid:2)(k(cid:4)mv2)2b(cid:3)F vc.

If the factor (k(cid:4)mv2)2(cid:2)v2c2is not zero, we can divide by this factor and solve for a
and b,
k(cid:4)mv2 vc

We thus obtain the general solution of the nonhomogeneous ODE (2) in the form
(6) y(t)(cid:3)y (t)(cid:2)y (t).

Here y is a general solution of the homogeneous ODE (1) and y is given by (3) with
h p
coefficients (5).
We shall now discuss the behavior of the mechanical system, distinguishing between
the two cases c(cid:3)0 (no damping) and c(cid:6)0 (damping). These cases will correspond to
two basically different types of output.
Case 1. Undamped Forced Oscillations. Resonance
If the damping of the physical system is so small that its effect can be neglected over the
time interval considered, we can set c(cid:3)0. Then (5) reduces to a(cid:3)F [m(v2 (cid:4)v2)]

function is large, and we obtain an oscillation of the type shown in Fig. 56, the dashed
curve resulting from the first sine factor. This is what musicians are listening to when
they tune their instruments.

and natural frequencies is small(“beats”)
Case 2. Damped Forced Oscillations
If the damping of the mass–spring system is not negligibly small, we have c(cid:6)0 and
r
a damping term cy in (1) and (2). Then the general solution y of the homogeneous
h
ODE (1) approaches zero as t goes to infinity, as we know from Sec. 2.4. Practically,
it is zero after a sufficiently long time. Hence the “transient solution” (6) of (2),
given by y(cid:3)y (cid:2)y , approaches the “steady-state solution” y . This proves the
h p p
following.
THEOREM 1 Steady-State Solution
After a sufficiently long time the output of a damped vibrating system under a purely
sinusoidal driving force [see (2)] will practically be a harmonic oscillation whose
frequency is that of the input.

Amplitude of the Steady-State Solution. Practical Resonance
Whereas in the undamped case the amplitude of y approaches infinity as v approaches
p
v , this will not happen in the damped case. In this case the amplitude will always be
0
finite. But it may have a maximum for some v depending on the damping constant c.
This may be called practical resonance. It is of great importance because if c is not too
large, then some input may excite oscillations large enough to damage or even destroy
the system. Such cases happened, in particular in earlier times when less was known about
resonance. Machines, cars, ships, airplanes, bridges, and high-rising buildings are vibrating
mechanical systems, and it is sometimes rather difficult to find constructions that are
completely free of undesired resonance effects, caused, for instance, by an engine or by
strong winds.
To study the amplitude of y as a function of v, we write (3) in the form
p
(13) y (t)(cid:3)C* cos (vt(cid:4)h).
p
C* is called the amplitudeof y and hthe phase angleor phase lagbecause it measures
p
the lag of the output behind the input. According to (5), these quantities are

By reshuffling terms we have

The right side of this equation becomes negative if c2(cid:6)2mk, so that then (15) has no
real solution and C* decreases monotone as v increases, as the lowest curve in Fig. 57
shows. If c is smaller, c2(cid:7)2mk, then (15) has a real solution v(cid:3)v , where

Designing good models is a task the computer cannot do. Hence setting up models has
become an important task in modern applied mathematics. The best way to gain experience
in successful modeling is to carefully examine the modeling process in various fields and
applications. Accordingly, modeling electric circuits will be profitable for all students,
not just for electrical engineers and computer scientists.
Figure 61 shows an RLC-circuit, as it occurs as a basic building block of large electric
networks in computers and elsewhere. An RLC-circuit is obtained from an RL-circuitby
adding a capacitor. Recall Example 2 on the RL-circuit in Sec. 1.5: The model of the
RL-circuit is LIr (cid:2)RI(cid:3)E(t). It was obtained by KVL (Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law)7by
equating the voltage drops across the resistor and the inductor to the EMF (electromotive
force). Hence we obtain the model of the RLC-circuit simply by adding the voltage drop

This is an “integro-differential equation.” To get rid of the integral, we differentiate (1 )
with respect to t, obtaining

This shows that the current in an RLC-circuit is obtained as the solution of this
nonhomogeneous second-order ODE (1) with constant coefficients.

Solving the ODE (1) for the Current in an RLC-Circuit
A general solution of (1) is the sum I(cid:3)I (cid:2)I , where I is a general solution of the
h p h
homogeneous ODE corresponding to (1) and I is a particular solution of (1). We first
p
determine I by the method of undetermined coefficients, proceeding as in the previous

0
and we equate the sine terms to zero because there is no sine term on the right,

Lv2((cid:4)b)(cid:2)Rv((cid:4)a)(cid:2)b C(cid:3)0 (Sine terms).

Before solving this system for a and b, we first introduce a combination of L and C, called
the reactance

We now eliminate b by multiplying the first equation by S and the second by R, and
adding. Then we eliminate a by multiplying the first equation by R and the second by
(cid:4)S, and adding. This gives
(cid:4)(S2(cid:2)R2)a(cid:3)E S, (R2(cid:2)S2)b(cid:3)E R.

Equation (2) with coefficients a and b given by (4) is the desired particular solution I of

the nonhomogeneous ODE (1) governing the current I in an RLC-circuit with sinusoidal
electromotive force.
Using (4), we can write I in terms of “physically visible” quantities, namely, amplitude

The quantity 2R2(cid:2)S2is called the impedance. Our formula shows that the impedance
equals the ratio E I .This is somewhat analogous to E I(cid:3)R(Ohm’s law) and, because
0> 0 >
of this analogy, the impedance is also known as the apparent resistance.

Now in an actual circuit, R is never zero (hence R(cid:6)0). From this it follows that I

the transient current I(cid:3)I (cid:2)I tends to the steady-state current I ,and after some time
h p p
the output will practically be a harmonic oscillation, which is given by (5) and whose
frequency is that of the input (of the electromotive force).

EXAMPLE 1 RLC-Circuit
Find the current I(t)in an RLC-circuit with R(cid:3)11 (cid:13)(ohms), L(cid:3)0.1 H(henry), C(cid:3)10(cid:2)2 F(farad), which

usual in the U.S. and Canada; in Europe it would be 220 V and 50 Hz). Assume that current and capacitor
charge are 0 when t(cid:3)0.
Solution. Step 1. General solution of the homogeneous ODE.Substituting R,L,C and the derivative Er (t)
into (1), we obtain
0.1Is(cid:2)11Ir(cid:2)100I(cid:3)110 #
377 cos 377t.
Hence the homogeneous ODE is
0.1Is(cid:2)11Ir(cid:2)100I(cid:3)0.Its
characteristic equation is
0.1l2(cid:2)11l(cid:2)100(cid:3)0.
The roots are l (cid:3)(cid:4)10and l (cid:3)(cid:4)100.The corresponding general solution of the homogeneous ODE is

Hence in our present case, a general solution of the nonhomogeneous ODE (1) is

Step 3. Particular solution satisfying the initial conditions. How to useQ(0)(cid:3)0?We finally determine c

and c from the in initial conditions I(0)(cid:3)0and Q(0)(cid:3)0.From the first condition and (6) we have
2
(7) I(0)(cid:3)c (cid:2)c (cid:4)2.71(cid:3)0, hence c (cid:3)2.71(cid:4)c .
1 2 2 1
We turn to Q(0)(cid:3)0.The integral in (1r )equals (cid:3)I dt(cid:3)Q(t);see near the beginning of this section. Hence for
t(cid:3)0,Eq. (1r )becomes
LIr (0)(cid:2)R # 0(cid:3)0, so that Ir (0)(cid:3)0.
Differentiating (6) and setting t(cid:3)0,we thus obtain
Ir (0)(cid:3)(cid:4)10c (cid:4)100c (cid:2)0(cid:2)0.796 # 377(cid:3)0, hence by (7), (cid:4)10c (cid:3)100(2.71(cid:4)c )(cid:4)300.1.
1 2 1 1
The solution of this and (7) is c (cid:3)(cid:4)0.323, c (cid:3)3.033.Hence the answer is
1 2
I(t)(cid:3)(cid:4)0.323e(cid:2)10t(cid:2)3.033e(cid:2)100t(cid:4)2.71 cos 377t(cid:2)0.796 sin 377t.
You may get slightly different values depending on the rounding. Figure 63 shows I(t)as well as I (t),which
p
practically coincide, except for a very short time near t(cid:3)0because the exponential terms go to zero very rapidly.
Thus after a very short time the current will practically execute harmonic oscillations of the input frequency
60 Hz(cid:3)60cycles sec. Its maximum amplitude and phase lag can be seen from (5), which here takes the form

Analogy of Electrical and Mechanical Quantities
Entirely different physical or other systems may have the same mathematical model.
For instance, we have seen this from the various applications of the ODE yr (cid:3)ky in
Chap. 1. Another impressive demonstration of this unifying power of mathematics is
given by the ODE (1) for an electric RLC-circuit and the ODE (2) in the last section for
a mass–spring system. Both equations
LIs (cid:2)RIr (cid:2) 1 I(cid:3)E vcos vt and mys (cid:2)cyr (cid:2)ky(cid:3)F cos vt
C 0 0
are of the same form. Table 2.2 shows the analogy between the various quantities involved.
The inductance L corresponds to the mass m and, indeed, an inductor opposes a change
in current, having an “inertia effect” similar to that of a mass. The resistance R corresponds
to the damping constant c, and a resistor causes loss of energy, just as a damping dashpot
does. And so on.
This analogy is strictly quantitativein the sense that to a given mechanical system we
can construct an electric circuit whose current will give the exact values of the displacement
in the mechanical system when suitable scale factors are introduced.
The practical importance of this analogy is almost obvious. The analogy may be used
for constructing an “electrical model” of a given mechanical model, resulting in substantial
savings of time and money because electric circuits are easy to assemble, and electric
quantities can be measured much more quickly and accurately than mechanical ones.

Solution by Variation of Parameters
We continue our discussion of nonhomogeneous linear ODEs, that is
(1) ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)r(x).
In Sec. 2.6 we have seen that a general solution of (1) is the sum of a general solution y
h
of the corresponding homogeneous ODE and any particular solution y of (1). To obtain y
p p
when r(x)is not too complicated, we can often use the method of undetermined coefficients,
as we have shown in Sec. 2.7 and applied to basic engineering models in Secs. 2.8 and 2.9.
However, since this method is restricted to functions r(x)whose derivatives are of a form
similar to r(x)itself (powers, exponential functions, etc.), it is desirable to have a method valid
for more general ODEs (1), which we shall now develop. It is called the method of variation
of parameters and is credited to Lagrange (Sec. 2.1). Here p, q, r in (1) may be variable
(given functions of x),but we assume that they are continuous on some open interval I.
Lagrange’s method gives a particular solution y of (1) on I in the form
p
(cid:4)y r (cid:4)y r

(4) W(cid:3)y yr (cid:4)y yr (see Sec. 2.6).

CAUTION! The solution formula (2) is obtained under the assumption that the ODE
s
is written in standard form, with y as the first term as shown in (1). If it starts with
s
f(x)y ,divide first by f(x).
c02.qxd 10/27/10 6:06 PM Page 100
100 CHAP. 2 Second-Order Linear ODEs
The integration in (2) may often cause difficulties, and so may the determination of
y , y if (1) has variable coefficients. If you have a choice, use the previous method. It is
1 2
simpler. Before deriving (2) let us work an example for which you do need the new
method. (Try otherwise.)

of the homogeneous ODE (3) on an open interval I and to replace the constants (“the
parameters”) c and c by functions u(x) and v(x); this suggests the name of the method.
1 2
We shall determine u and v so that the resulting function
(5) y (x) (cid:3)u(x)y (x)(cid:2)v(x)y (x)
p 1 2
is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous ODE (1). Note that y exists by Theorem
h
3 in Sec. 2.6 because of the continuity of p and q on I. (The continuity of r will be used
later.)

Now y must satisfy (1). This is one condition for two functions u and v. It seems plausible
p
that we may impose a second condition. Indeed, our calculation will show that we can
determine u and v such that y satisfies (1) and u and v satisfy as a second condition the

We now substitute y and its derivatives according to (5), (7), (8) into (1). Collecting

This is a linear system of two algebraic equations for the unknown functions u and v .

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Second-Order Linear ODEs
Second-order linear ODEs are particularly important in applications, for instance,
in mechanics (Secs. 2.4, 2.8) and electrical engineering (Sec. 2.9). A second-order
ODE is called linear if it can be written
(1) ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)r(x) (Sec. 2.1).
s
(If the first term is, say, f(x)y ,divide by f(x)to get the “standard form” (1) with
s
y as the first term.) Equation (1) is called homogeneous if r(x) is zero for all x
considered, usually in some open interval; this is written r(x)(cid:2)0.Then
(2) ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)0.
Equation (1) is called nonhomogeneous if r(x) [ 0 (meaning r(x) is not zero for
some x considered).

(2) and (3) together form an initial value problem. Similarly for (1) and (3).
For a nonhomogeneous ODE (1) a general solution is of the form
(4) y(cid:3)y (cid:2)y (Sec. 2.7).
h p
Here y is a general solution of (2) and y is a particular solution of (1). Such a y
h p p
can be determined by a general method (variation of parameters, Sec. 2.10) or in
many practical cases by the method of undetermined coefficients. The latter applies
when (1) has constant coefficients p and q, and r(x) is a power of x, sine, cosine,
etc. (Sec. 2.7). Then we write (1) as
(5) ys (cid:2)ayr (cid:2)by(cid:3)r(x) (Sec. 2.7).
The corresponding homogeneous ODE yr (cid:2)ayr (cid:2)by(cid:3)0 has solutions y(cid:3)elx,
where l is a root of
(6) l2(cid:2)al(cid:2)b(cid:3)0.
Hence there are three cases (Sec. 2.2):

Important applications of (5) in mechanical and electrical engineering in connection
with vibrations and resonance are discussed in Secs. 2.4, 2.7, and 2.8.
Another large class of ODEs solvable “algebraically” consists of the Euler–Cauchy
equations
(7) x2ys (cid:2)axyr (cid:2)by(cid:3)0 (Sec. 2.5).
These have solutions of the form y(cid:3)xm,where m is a solution of the auxiliary equation
(8) m2(cid:2)(a(cid:4)1)m(cid:2)b(cid:3)0.
Existence and uniqueness of solutions of (1) and (2) is discussed in Secs. 2.6
and 2.7, and reduction of order in Sec. 2.1.

Higher Order Linear ODEs
The concepts and methods of solving linear ODEs of order n(cid:3)2extend nicely to linear
ODEs of higher order n, that is, n(cid:3)3, 4, etc. This shows that the theory explained in
Chap. 2 for second-order linear ODEs is attractive, since it can be extended in a
straightforward way to arbitrary n. We do so in this chapter and notice that the formulas
become more involved, the variety of roots of the characteristic equation (in Sec. 3.2)
becomes much larger with increasing n, and the Wronskian plays a more prominent role.
The concepts and methods of solving second-order linear ODEs extend readily to linear
ODEs of higher order.
This chapter follows Chap. 2 naturally, since the results of Chap. 2 can be readily
extended to that of Chap. 3.

3.1
Homogeneous Linear ODEs
Recall from Sec. 1.1 that an ODE is of nth orderif the nth derivative y(n)(cid:3)dny dxnof
>
the unknown function y(x)is the highest occurring derivative. Thus the ODE is of the form
F(x, y, yr ,Á , y(n))(cid:3)0
where lower order derivatives and y itself may or may not occur. Such an ODE is called
linear if it can be written
(1) y(n)(cid:2)p (x)y(n(cid:2)1)(cid:2) Á (cid:2)p (x)yr (cid:2)p (x)y(cid:3)r(x).
n(cid:2)1 1 0
(For n(cid:3)2this is (1) in Sec. 2.1 with p (cid:3)pand p (cid:3)q.) The coefficientsp ,Á , p
1 0 0 n(cid:2)1
and the function r on the right are any given functions of x, and y is unknown. y(n) has
coefficient 1. We call this the standard form. (If you have p (x)y(n), divide by p (x)
n n
to get this form.) An nth-order ODE that cannot be written in the form (1) is called
nonlinear.
If r(x) is identically zero, r(x)(cid:2)0 (zero for all x considered, usually in some open
interval I), then (1) becomes
(2) y(n)(cid:2)p (x)y(n(cid:2)1)(cid:2) Á (cid:2)p (x)yr (cid:2)p (x)y(cid:3)0

and is called homogeneous. If r(x) is not identically zero, then the ODE is called
nonhomogeneous. This is as in Sec. 2.1.
A solution of an nth-order (linear or nonlinear) ODE on some open interval I is a
function y(cid:3)h(x)that is defined and ntimes differentiable on Iand is such that the ODE
becomes an identity if we replace the unknown function yand its derivatives by hand its
corresponding derivatives.
Sections 3.1–3.2 will be devoted to homogeneous linear ODEs and Section 3.3 to
nonhomogeneous linear ODEs.
Homogeneous Linear ODE: Superposition Principle,
General Solution
The basic superposition or linearity principle of Sec. 2.1 extends to nth order
homogeneous linear ODEs as follows.
THEOREM 1 Fundamental Theorem for the Homogeneous Linear ODE (2)
For a homogeneous linear ODE (2), sums and constant multiples of solutions on
some open interval I are again solutions on I. (This does not hold for a
nonhomogeneous or nonlinear ODE!)
The proof is a simple generalization of that in Sec. 2.1 and we leave it to the student.
Our further discussion parallels and extends that for second-order ODEs in Sec. 2.1.
So we next define a general solution of (2), which will require an extension of linear
independence from 2 to n functions.
DEFINITION General Solution, Basis, Particular Solution
A general solutionof (2) on an open interval Iis a solution of (2) on Iof the form
(3) y(x)(cid:3)c y (x)(cid:2) Á (cid:2)c y (x) (c ,Á , c arbitrary)
1 1 n n 1 n
Á
where y , , y is a basis (or fundamental system) of solutions of (2) on I; that
1 n
is, these solutions are linearly independent on I, as defined below.
A particular solution of (2) on I is obtained if we assign specific values to the
Á
n constants c , , c in (3).

DEFINITION Linear Independence and Dependence
Á
Consider n functions y (x), , y (x) defined on some interval I.
1 n
These functions are called linearly independent on I if the equation
(4) k y (x) (cid:2) Á (cid:2)k y (x)(cid:3)0 on I
1 1 n n
Á
implies that all k , , k are zero. These functions are called linearly dependent
1 n
Á
on I if this equation also holds on I for some k , , k not all zero.

Á
If and only if y , , y are linearly dependent on I, we can express (at least) one of
1 n
these functions on Ias a “linear combination” of the other n(cid:4)1functions, that is, as a
sum of those functions, each multiplied by a constant (zero or not). This motivates the
term “linearly dependent.” For instance, if (4) holds with k (cid:6)0, we can divide by k
1 1
and express y as the linear combination
1
y (cid:3)(cid:4) 1 (k y (cid:2) Á (cid:2)k y ).

Note that when n(cid:3)2, these concepts reduce to those defined in Sec. 2.1.

EXAMPLE 2 Linear Independence

Solution. Equation (4) is k x(cid:2)k x2(cid:2)k x3(cid:3)0.Taking (a) x(cid:3)(cid:4)1,(b) x(cid:3)1,(c) x(cid:3)2,we get
1 2 3
(a) (cid:4)k (cid:2)k (cid:4)k (cid:3)0, (b) k (cid:2)k (cid:2)k (cid:3)0, (c) 2k (cid:2)4k (cid:2)8k (cid:3)0.

A better method for testing linear independence of solutions of ODEs will soon be explained.

Solution. As in Sec. 2.2 we substitute y(cid:3)elx. Omitting the common factor elx,we obtain the characteristic
equation
l4(cid:4)5l2(cid:2)4(cid:3)0.
This is a quadratic equation in (cid:2)(cid:3)l2,namely,
(cid:2)2(cid:4)5(cid:2)(cid:2)4(cid:3)((cid:2)(cid:4)1)((cid:2)(cid:4)4)(cid:3)0.
The roots are (cid:2)(cid:3)1 and 4. Hence l(cid:3)(cid:4)2, (cid:4)1, 1, 2. This gives four solutions. A general solution on any
interval is

Initial Value Problem. Existence and Uniqueness

In extension of the existence and uniqueness theorem in Sec. 2.6 we now have the
following.
THEOREM 2 Existence and Uniqueness Theorem for Initial Value Problems
Á
If the coefficients p (x), , p (x) of (2) are continuous on some open interval I
0 n(cid:2)1
and x is in I, then the initial value problem (2), (5)has a unique solution y(x)on I.

Existence is proved in Ref. [A11] in App. 1. Uniqueness can be proved by a slight
generalization of the uniqueness proof at the beginning of App. 4.
EXAMPLE 4 Initial Value Problem for a Third-Order Euler–Cauchy Equation
Solve the following initial value problem on any open interval Ion the positive x-axis containing x(cid:3)1.
x3yt(cid:4)3x2ys(cid:2)6xyr(cid:4)6y(cid:3)0, y(1)(cid:3)2, yr (1)(cid:3)1, ys (1)(cid:3)(cid:4)4.
Solution. Step 1. General solution.As in Sec. 2.5 we try y(cid:3)xm.By differentiation and substitution,
m(m(cid:4)1)(m(cid:4)2)xm(cid:4)3m(m(cid:4)1)xm(cid:2)6mxm(cid:4)6xm(cid:3)0.
Dropping xmand ordering gives m3(cid:4)6m2(cid:2)11m(cid:4)6(cid:3)0.If we can guess the root m(cid:3)1.We can divide
by m(cid:4)1and find the other roots 2 and 3, thus obtaining the solutions x, x2, x3,which are linearly independent
on I (see Example 2). [In general one shall need a root-finding method, such as Newton’s (Sec. 19.2), also
available in a CAS (Computer Algebra System).] Hence a general solution is
y(cid:3)c x(cid:2)c x2(cid:2)c x3
1 2 3
valid on any interval I, even when it includes x(cid:3)0where the coefficients of the ODE divided by x3(to have
the standard form) are not continuous.
Step 2. Particular solution.The derivatives are yr(cid:3)c (cid:2)2c x(cid:2)3c x2and ys(cid:3)2c (cid:2)6c x.From this, and
yand the initial conditions, we get by setting x(cid:3)1

This is solved by Cramer’s rule (Sec. 7.6), or by elimination, which is simple, as follows. (b)(cid:4)(a) gives
(d)c (cid:2)2c (cid:3)(cid:4)1.Then (c) (cid:4)2(d) gives c (cid:3)(cid:4)1.Then (c) gives c (cid:3)1.Finally c (cid:3)2from (a).

Linear Independence of Solutions. Wronskian
Linear independence of solutions is crucial for obtaining general solutions. Although itcan
often be seen by inspection, it would be good to have a criterion for it. Now Theorem 2
in Sec. 2.6 extends from order n(cid:3)2to any n. This extended criterion uses the Wronskian

Note that W depends on x since y , , y do. The criterion states that these solutions
1 n
form a basis if and only if W is not zero; more precisely:

Let the ODE(2)have continuous coefficients p (x), , p (x)on an open interval

I. Then n solutions y , , y of (2)on I are linearly dependent on I if and only if their
1 n
Wronskian is zero for some x(cid:3)x in I. Furthermore, if W is zero for x(cid:3)x ,then W

Á
is identically zero on I. Hence if there is an x in I at which W is not zero, then y , , y
1 1 n
are linearly independent on I, so that they form a basis of solutions of(2)on I.
Á
PROOF (a) Let y , , y be linearly dependent solutions of (2) on I. Then, by definition, there

are constants k , , k not all zero, such that for all x in I,

(7), (8) is a homogeneous linear system of algebraic equations with a nontrivial solution

k , , k . Hence its coefficient determinant must be zero for every x on I, by Cramer’s
1 n
theorem (Sec. 7.7). But that determinant is the Wronskian W, as we see from (6). Hence
W is zero for every x on I.
(b) Conversely, if W is zero at an x in I, then the system (7), (8) with x(cid:3)x has a
0 0

solution k*, , k*, not all zero, by the same theorem. With these constants we define
1 n
the solution y*(cid:3)k*y (cid:2) Á (cid:2)k*y of (2) on I. By (7), (8) this solution satisfies the
1 1 n n
initial conditions y*(x )(cid:3)0,Á , y*(n(cid:2)1)(x )(cid:3)0. But another solution satisfying the
0 0
same conditions is y(cid:2)0.Hence y*(cid:2)yby Theorem 2, which applies since the coefficients
of (2) are continuous. Together, y*(cid:3)k*y (cid:2) Á (cid:2)k*y (cid:2)0 on I. This means linear

A General Solution of (2) Includes All Solutions
Let us first show that general solutions always exist. Indeed, Theorem 3 in Sec. 2.6 extends
as follows.
THEOREM 4 Existence of a General Solution
Á
If the coefficients p (x), , p (x)of (2)are continuous on some open interval I,
0 n(cid:2)1
then (2) has a general solution on I.

PROOF We choose any fixed x in I. By Theorem 2 the ODE (2) has nsolutions y , , y ,where
0 1 n
y satisfies initial conditions (5) with K (cid:3)1 and all other K’s equal to zero. Their
j j(cid:2)1
Wronskian at x equals 1. For instance, when n(cid:3)3, then y (x )(cid:3)1, yr (x )(cid:3)1,
0 1 0 2 0
ys (x )(cid:3)1, and the other initial values are zero. Thus, as claimed,

Hence for any n those solutions y 4,Á , y are linearly indepe4nde4nt on I, by 4Theorem 3.

They form a basis on I, and y(cid:3)c y (cid:2) Á (cid:2)c y is a general solution of (2) on I. (cid:2)
1 1 n n
We can now prove the basic property that, from a general solution of (2), every solution
of (2) can be obtained by choosing suitable values of the arbitrary constants. Hence an
nth-order linearODE has no singular solutions, that is, solutions that cannot be obtained
from a general solution.
THEOREM 5 General Solution Includes All Solutions

If the ODE (2)has continuous coefficients p (x), , p (x)on some open interval

where y , , y is a basis of solutions of (2)on I and C , , C are suitable constants.

are linearly independent, so that W is not zero by Theorem 3. Hence (10) has a unique
solution c (cid:3)C ,Á , c (cid:3)C (by Cramer’s theorem in Sec. 7.7). With these values we
1 1 n n
obtain the particular solution
y*(x) (cid:3)C y (x)(cid:2) Á (cid:2)C y (x)

on I. Equation (10) shows that y* and its first n(cid:4)1 derivatives agree at x with Y and
0
its corresponding derivatives. That is, y*and Ysatisfy, at x , the same initial conditions.
0
The uniqueness theorem (Theorem 2) now implies that y*(cid:2)Y on I. This proves the
theorem. (cid:2)
This completes our theory of the homogeneous linear ODE (2). Note that for n(cid:3)2 it is
identical with that in Sec. 2.6. This had to be expected.

Homogeneous Linear ODEs
with Constant Coefficients
We proceed along the lines of Sec. 2.2, and generalize the results from n(cid:3)2to arbitrary n.
We want to solve an nth-order homogeneous linear ODE with constant coefficients,
written as
(1) y(n)(cid:2)a y(n(cid:2)1)(cid:2) Á (cid:2)a yr (cid:2)a y(cid:3)0

of (1). If lis a root of (2), then y(cid:3)elxis a solution of (1). To find these roots, you may
need a numeric method, such as Newton’s in Sec. 19.2, also available on the usual CASs.
For general nthere are more cases than for n(cid:3)2.We can have distinct real roots, simple
complex roots, multiple roots, and multiple complex roots, respectively. This will be shown
next and illustrated by examples.
Distinct Real Roots
Á
If all the n roots l , , l of (2) are real and different, then the n solutions
1 n
(3) y (cid:3)el 1x, Á , y (cid:3)el nx.
1 n
constitute a basis for all x. The corresponding general solution of (1) is
(4) y(cid:3)c el 1x(cid:2) Á (cid:2)c el nx.
1 n
Indeed, the solutions in (3) are linearly independent, as we shall see after the example.
EXAMPLE 1 Distinct Real Roots

Solution. The characteristic equation is l3(cid:4)2l2(cid:4)l(cid:2)2(cid:3)0.It has the roots (cid:4)1, 1, 2;if you find one
of them by inspection, you can obtain the other two roots by solving a quadratic equation (explain!). The
corresponding general solution (4) is y(cid:3)c e(cid:2)x(cid:2)c ex(cid:2)c e2x. (cid:2)

Linear Independence of (3). Students familiar with nth-order determinants may verify
that, by pulling out all exponential functions from the columns and denoting their product
by E(cid:3)exp [l (cid:2) Á (cid:2)l )x], the Wronskian of the solutions in (3) becomes

The exponential function Eis never zero. Hence W(cid:3)0if and only if the determinant on
the right is zero. This is a so-called Vandermonde or Cauchy determinant.1 It can be
shown that it equals
(6) ((cid:4)1)n(n(cid:2)1) >2V

we get (cid:4)V(cid:3)(cid:4)(l (cid:4)l )(l (cid:4)l )(l (cid:4)l ).This shows that the Wronskian is not zero
1 2 1 3 2 3
if and only if all the n roots of (2) are different and thus gives the following.
THEOREM 1 Basis
Solutions y (cid:3)el 1x,Á , y (cid:3)el nx of (1) (with any real or complex l’s) form a
1 n j
basis of solutions of (1) on any open interval if and only if all n roots of (2) are
different.
Actually, Theorem 1 is an important special case of our more general result obtained
from (5) and (6):
THEOREM 2 Linear Independence
Any number of solutions of (1)of the form elxare linearly independent on an open
interval I if and only if the corresponding l are all different.
Simple Complex Roots
If complex roots occur, they must occur in conjugate pairs since the coefficients of (1)
are real. Thus, if l(cid:3)g(cid:2)ivis a simple root of (2), so is the conjugate l(cid:3)g(cid:4)iv,and
two corresponding linearly independent solutions are (as in Sec. 2.2, except for notation)
y (cid:3)egx cos vx, y (cid:3)egx sin vx.

Solution. The characteristic equation is l3(cid:4)l2(cid:2)100l(cid:4)100(cid:3)0.It has the root 1, as can perhaps be
seen by inspection. Then division by l(cid:4)1shows that the other roots are (cid:9)10i.Hence a general solution and
its derivatives (obtained by differentiation) are

Now let l be a root of mth order of the polynomial on the right, where m(cid:5)n.For m(cid:10)n
1
Á
let l , , l be the other roots, all different from l . Writing the polynomial in
m(cid:3)1 n 1
product form, we then have
L[elx](cid:3)(l(cid:4)l )mh(l)elx
1
with h(l)(cid:3)1if m(cid:3)n,and h(l)(cid:3)(l(cid:4)l )Á (l(cid:4)l )if m(cid:10)n.Now comes the
m(cid:2)1 n
key idea: We differentiate on both sides with respect to l,
0 0
(9) L[elx](cid:3)m(l(cid:4)l )m(cid:2)1h(l)elx(cid:2)(l(cid:4)l )m [h(l)elx].
0l 1 1 0l
The differentiations with respect to xand lare independent and the resulting derivatives
are continuous, so that we can interchange their order on the left:
0 0
(10) L[elx](cid:3)L elx (cid:3)L[xelx].
0l c0l d
The right side of (9) is zero for l(cid:3)l because of the factors l(cid:4)l (and m(cid:11)2 since
1 1
we have a multiple root!). Hence L[xel 1x](cid:3)0 by (9) and (10). This proves that xel 1x is
a solution of (1).
We can repeat this step and produce x2el 1x,Á , xm(cid:2)1el 1x by another m(cid:4)2 such
differentiations with respect to l.Going one step further would no longer give zero on the
right because the lowest power of l(cid:4)l would then be (l(cid:4)l )0,multiplied by m!h(l)
1 1
and h(l )(cid:6)0because h(l) has no factors l(cid:4)l ;so we get preciselythe solutions in (7).
1 1
We finally show that the solutions (7) are linearly independent. For a specific n this
can be seen by calculating their Wronskian, which turns out to be nonzero. For arbitrary
mwe can pull out the exponential functions from the Wronskian. This gives (elx)m(cid:3)elmx
times a determinant which by “row operations” can be reduced to the Wronskian of 1,
x,Á , xm(cid:2)1. The latter is constant and different from zero (equal to 1!2!Á (m(cid:4)1)!).
These functions are solutions of the ODE y(m)(cid:3)0, so that linear independence follows
from Theroem 3 in Sec. 3.1.
Multiple Complex Roots
In this case, real solutions are obtained as for complex simple roots above. Consequently,
if l(cid:3)g(cid:2)ivis a complex double root, so is the conjugate l(cid:3)g(cid:4)iv.Corresponding
linearly independent solutions are
(11) egx cos vx, egx sin vx, xegx cos vx, xegx sin vx.
The first two of these result from elx and elx as before, and the second two from xelx
and xelx in the same fashion. Obviously, the corresponding general solution is
(12) y(cid:3)egx[(A (cid:2)A x) cos vx (cid:2)(B (cid:2)B x) sin vx].
1 2 1 2
For complex triple roots (which hardly ever occur in applications), one would obtain
two more solutions x2egx cos vx, x2egx sin vx, and so on.

the method of undetermined coefficients, as in Sec. 2.7, using the following rules.
(A) Basic Rule as in Sec. 2.7.
(B) Modification Rule. If a term in your choice for y (x) is a solution of the
p
homogeneous equation (3), then multiply this term by xk, where k is the smallest
positive integer such that this term times xk is not a solution of (3).
(C) Sum Rule as in Sec. 2.7.
The practical application of the method is the same as that in Sec. 2.7. It suffices to
illustrate the typical steps of solving an initial value problem and, in particular, the new
Modification Rule, which includes the old Modification Rule as a particular case (with
k(cid:3)1or 2). We shall see that the technicalities are the same as for n(cid:3)2,except perhaps
for the more involved determination of the constants.

Method of Variation of Parameters
The method of variation of parameters (see Sec. 2.10) also extends to arbitrary order n.
It gives a particular solution y for the nonhomogeneous equation (1) (in standard form

Application: Elastic Beams
Whereas second-order ODEs have various applications, of which we have discussed some
of the more important ones, higher order ODEs have much fewer engineering applications.
An important fourth-order ODE governs the bending of elastic beams, such as wooden or
iron girders in a building or a bridge.
A related application of vibration of beams does not fit in here since it leads to PDEs
and will therefore be discussed in Sec. 12.3.
EXAMPLE 3 Bending of an Elastic Beam under a Load
We consider a beam B of length L and constant (e.g., rectangular) cross section and homogeneous elastic
material (e.g., steel); see Fig. 76. We assume that under its own weight the beam is bent so little that it is
practically straight. If we apply a load to B in a vertical plane through the axis of symmetry (the x-axis in
Fig.76), Bis bent. Its axis is curved into the so-called elastic curveC(or deflection curve). It is shown in
elasticity theory that the bending moment M(x)is proportional to the curvature k(x)of C. We assume the bending
r
to be small, so that the deflection y(x)and its derivative y (x)(determining the tangent direction of C) are small.
Then, by calculus,
k(cid:3)ys (1(cid:2)yr2)3 >2(cid:5)ys
.Hence

The boundary condition y(cid:3)0means no displacement at that point, yr(cid:3)0means a horizontal tangent, ys(cid:3)0
means no bending moment, and
yt(cid:3)0means
no shear force.

Since the boundary conditions at both ends are the same, we expect the deflection y(x)to be “symmetric” with

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Higher Order Linear ODEs
Compare with the similar Summary of Chap. 2 (the case n(cid:4)2).
Chapter 3 extends Chap. 2 from order n(cid:3)2 to arbitrary order n. An nth-order
linear ODE is an ODE that can be written
(1) y(n)(cid:2)p (x)y(n(cid:2)1)(cid:2) Á (cid:2)p (x)yr (cid:2)p (x)y(cid:3)r(x)
n(cid:2)1 1 0
with y(n)(cid:3)dny dxnas the first term; we again call this the standard form. Equation
>
(1) is called homogeneous if r(x)(cid:2)0 on a given open interval I considered,
nonhomogeneous if r(x) [ 0 on I. For the homogeneous ODE
(2) y(n)(cid:2)p (x)y(n(cid:2)1)(cid:2) Á (cid:2)p (x)yr (cid:2)p (x)y(cid:3)0
n(cid:2)1 1 0
the superposition principle (Sec. 3.1) holds, just as in the case n(cid:3)2. A basis or
fundamental system of solutions of (2) on I consists of n linearly independent
Á
solutions y , , y of (2) on I. A general solutionof (2) on Iis a linear combination
1 n
of these,
(3) y(cid:3)c y (cid:2) Á (cid:2)c y (c ,Á , c arbitrary constants).
1 1 n n 1 n
A general solution of the nonhomogeneous ODE (1) on I is of the form
(4) y(cid:3)y (cid:2)y (Sec. 3.3).
h p
Here, y is a particular solution of (1) and is obtained by two methods (undetermined
p
coefficients or variation of parameters) explained in Sec. 3.3.
An initial value problem for (1) or (2) consists of one of these ODEs and n
initial conditions (Secs. 3.1, 3.3)
(5) y(x )(cid:3)K , yr (x )(cid:3)K , Á , y(n(cid:2)1)(x )(cid:3)K

Á Á
with given x in I and given K , , K If p , , p , r are continuous on I,
0 0 n(cid:2)1. 0 n(cid:2)1
then general solutions of (1) and (2) on I exist, and initial value problems (1), (5)
or (2), (5) have a unique solution.

C H A P T E R
Systems of ODEs. Phase Plane.
Qualitative Methods
Tying in with Chap. 3, we present another method of solving higher order ODEs in
Sec. 4.1. This converts any nth-order ODE into a system of n first-order ODEs. We also
show some applications. Moreover, in the same section we solve systems of first-order
ODEs that occur directly in applications, that is, not derived from an nth-order ODE but
dictated by the application such as two tanks in mixing problems and two circuits in
electrical networks. (The elementary aspects of vectors and matrices needed in this chapter
are reviewed in Sec. 4.0 and are probably familiar to most students.)
In Sec. 4.3 we introduce a totally different way of looking at systems of ODEs. The
method consists of examining the general behavior of whole families of solutions of ODEs
in the phase plane, and aptly is called the phase plane method. It gives information on the
stability of solutions. (Stability of a physical systemis desirable and means roughly that a
small change at some instant causes only a small change in the behavior of the system at
later times.) This approach to systems of ODEs is a qualitative methodbecause it depends
only on the nature of the ODEs and does not require the actual solutions. This can be very
useful because it is often difficult or even impossible to solve systems of ODEs. In contrast,
the approach of actually solving a system is known as a quantitative method.
The phase plane method has many applications in control theory, circuit theory,
population dynamics and so on. Its use in linear systems is discussed in Secs. 4.3, 4.4,
and 4.6 and its even more important use in nonlinear systems is discussed in Sec. 4.5 with
applications to the pendulum equation and the Lokta–Volterra population model. The
chapter closes with a discussion of nonhomogeneous linear systems of ODEs.
NOTATION. We continue to denote unknown functions by y; thus, y (t), y (t)—

analogous to Chaps. 1–3. (Note that some authors use x for functions, x (t), x (t) when
1 2
dealing with systems of ODEs.)

Basics of Matrices and Vectors
For clarity and simplicity of notation, we use matrices and vectors in our discussion
of linear systems of ODEs. We need only a few elementary facts (and not the bulk of
the material of Chaps. 7 and 8). Most students will very likely be already familiar
124

withthese facts. Thus this section is for reference only.Begin with Sec. 4.1 and consult
4.0 as needed.
Most of our linear systems will consist of two linear ODEs in two unknown functions
y (t), y (t),

Some Definitions and Terms
Matrices. In (1) the (constant or variable) coefficients form a 2(cid:2) 2 matrix A, that is,
an array
a a (cid:3)5 2
11 12
(3) A(cid:2)[a ](cid:2) , for example, A(cid:2) .
jk c a a d c 13 1d
21 22 2
Similarly, the coefficients in (2) form an n(cid:2) n matrix
Á
a a a
11 12 1n

a a a

(4) A(cid:2)[a ](cid:2) .

The a , a , are called entries, the horizontal lines rows, and the vertical lines columns.
11 12
Thus, in (3) the first row is [a a ], the second row is [a a ], and the first and
11 12 21 22
second columns are
a a
11 12
and .
ca d ca d
21 22
In the “double subscript notation” for entries, the first subscript denotes the rowand the
second the column in which the entry stands. Similarly in (4). The main diagonal is the
diagonal a a
Á
a in (4), hence a a in (3).

We shall need only square matrices, that is, matrices with the same number of rows
and columns, as in (3) and (4).

Vectors. A column vector x with n components x , , x is of the form

Calculations with Matrices and Vectors
Equality. Two n (cid:5)n matrices are equal if and only if corresponding entries are equal.
Thus for n(cid:2)2, let
a a b b
11 12 11 12
A(cid:2) and B(cid:2) .
ca a d cb b d
21 22 21 22
Then A(cid:2) B if and only if
a (cid:2)b , a (cid:2)b
11 11 12 12
a (cid:2)b , a (cid:2)b .
21 21 22 22
Two column vectors (or two row vectors) are equal if and only if they both have n
components and corresponding components are equal. Thus, let
v x v (cid:2)x
1 1 1 1
v(cid:2) and x(cid:2) . Then v(cid:2)x if and only if
cv d cx d v (cid:2)x .
2 2 2 2
Addition is performed by adding corresponding entries (or components); here, matrices
must both be n(cid:5) n, and vectors must both have the same number of components. Thus
for n(cid:2)2,
a (cid:4)b a (cid:4)b v (cid:4)x
11 11 12 12 1 1
(5) A(cid:4)B(cid:2) , v(cid:4)x(cid:2) .
ca (cid:4)b a (cid:4)b d cv (cid:4)x d
21 21 22 22 2 2
Scalar multiplication (multiplication by a number c) is performed by multiplying each
entry (or component) by c. For example, if
9 3 (cid:3)63(cid:3)21
A(cid:2) , then (cid:3)7A(cid:2) .

Matrix Multiplication. The product C(cid:2)AB (in this order) of two n(cid:5)n matrices
A(cid:2)[a ] and B (cid:2)[b ] is the n (cid:5)n matrix C(cid:2)[c ] with entries

that is, multiply each entry in the jth rowof Aby the corresponding entry in the kth column
of Band then add these nproducts. One says briefly that this is a “multiplication of rows
into columns.” For example,
9 3 1 (cid:3)4 9(cid:4)1(cid:4)3(cid:4)2 9(cid:4)((cid:3)4)(cid:4)3(cid:4)5

Systems of ODEs as Vector Equations
Differentiation. The derivative of a matrix (or vector) with variable entries (or
components) is obtained by differentiating each entry (or component). Thus, if
y (t)

(t)
(cid:3)2e(cid:3)2t
y(t)(cid:2) 1 (cid:2) , then yr (t)(cid:2) 1 (cid:2) .

Using matrix multiplication and differentiation, we can now write (1) as
yr a a y (cid:3)5 2 y

Similarly for (2) by means of an n (cid:5)nmatrix A and a column vector ywith ncomponents,
namely, yr (cid:2)Ay. The vector equation (7) is equivalent to two equations for the
components, and these are precisely the two ODEs in (1).
Some Further Operations and Terms
Transpositionis the operation of writing columns as rows and conversely and is indicated
by T. Thus the transpose AT of the 2 (cid:5)2 matrix
a a (cid:3)5 2 a a (cid:3)5 13
11 12 11 21
A(cid:2) (cid:2) is AT(cid:2) (cid:2) .

The transpose of a column vector, say,

v(cid:2) , is a row vector, vT(cid:2)[v v ],

and conversely.
Inverse of a Matrix. The n (cid:5)nunit matrix Iis the n (cid:5)n matrix with main diagonal
1, 1,Á , 1 and all other entries zero. If, for a given n (cid:5)n matrix A, there is an n (cid:5)n
matrix Bsuch that AB(cid:2)BA(cid:2)I, thenAis called nonsingular and Bis called the inverse
of A and is denoted by
A(cid:3)1;
thus
(8)
AA(cid:3)1(cid:2)A(cid:3)1A(cid:2)I.
The inverse exists if the determinant det A of A is not zero.
If A has no inverse, it is called singular. For n(cid:2)2,
a (cid:3)a

Linear Independence. r given vectors v(1),Á , v(r) with n components are called a
linearly independent set or, more briefly, linearly independent, if
(11) c v(1)(cid:4) Á (cid:4)c v(r)(cid:2)0
1 r

Á
implies that all scalars c , , c must be zero; here, 0 denotes the zero vector, whose n
1 r
components are all zero. If (11) also holds for scalars not all zero (so that at least one of
these scalars is not zero), then these vectors are called a linearly dependent setor, briefly,
linearly dependent, because then at least one of them can be expressed as a linear
combination of the others; that is, if, for instance, c (cid:6)0 in (11), then we can obtain
1
v(1)(cid:2)(cid:3) 1 (c v(2)(cid:4) Á (cid:4)c v(r)).

Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors will be very important in this chapter (and, as a matter of
fact, throughout mathematics).
Let A(cid:2)[a ] be an n (cid:5)n matrix. Consider the equation
jk
(12) Ax (cid:2)lx
where l is a scalar (a real or complex number) to be determined and x is a vector to be
determined. Now, for every l, a solution is x(cid:2)0. A scalar l such that (12) holds for
some vector x(cid:6)0is called an eigenvalue of A, and this vector is called an eigenvector
of A corresponding to this eigenvalue l.
We can write (12) as Ax (cid:3)lx(cid:2)0 or
(13) (A(cid:3)lI)x(cid:2)0.
Á
These are n linear algebraic equations in the n unknowns x , , x (the components
1 n
of x). For these equations to have a solution x(cid:6)0, the determinant of the coefficient
matrix A(cid:3)lI must be zero. This is proved as a basic fact in linear algebra (Theorem 4
in Sec. 7.7). In this chapter we need this only for n(cid:2)2. Then (13) is
a (cid:3)l a x 0
11 12 1
(14) (cid:2) ;
c a a (cid:3)ld cx d c 0d

in components,

(14*) 11 1 12 2
a x (cid:4)(a (cid:3)l)x (cid:2)0.
21 1 22 2
Now A(cid:3)lIis singular if and only if its determinant det (A(cid:3)lI), called the characteristic
determinant of A(also for general n), is zero. This gives
a (cid:3)l a

This quadratic equation in l is called the characteristic equation of A. Its solutions are
the eigenvalues l and l of A. First determine these. Then use (14*) with l(cid:2)l to
1 2 1
determine an eigenvector x(1) of A corresponding to l . Finally use (14*) with l(cid:2)l
1 2
to find an eigenvector x(2) of A corresponding to l . Note that if x is an eigenvector of
2
A, so is kx with any k(cid:6)0.

It has the solutions l (cid:2)(cid:3)2 and l (cid:2)(cid:3)0.8. These are the eigenvalues of A.

Eigenvectors are obtained from (14*).2 For l(cid:2)l (cid:2)(cid:3)2w2 e have from (14*)

A solution of the first equation is x (cid:2)2, x (cid:2)1. This also satisfies the second equation. (Why?) Hence an

Systems of ODEs as Models
in Engineering Applications
We show how systems of ODEs are of practical importance as follows. We first illustrate
how systems of ODEs can serve as models in various applications. Then we show how a
higher order ODE (with the highest derivative standing alone on one side) can be reduced
to a first-order system.
EXAMPLE 1 Mixing Problem Involving Two Tanks
A mixing problem involving a single tank is modeled by a single ODE, and you may first review the
corresponding Example 3 in Sec. 1.3 because the principle of modeling will be the same for two tanks. The
model will be a system of two first-order ODEs.
Tank T and T in Fig. 78 contain initially 100 gal of water each. In T the water is pure, whereas 150 lb of
1 2 1
fertilizer are dissolved in T. By circulating liquid at a rate of 2 gal minand stirring (to keep the mixture uniform)
2 >
the amounts of fertilizer y (t)in T and y (t)in T change with time t. How long should we let the liquid circulate
1 1 2 2
so that T will contain at least half as much fertilizer as there will be left in T?

Solution. Step 1. Setting up the model.As for a single tank, the time rate of change yr (t)of y (t)equals
1 1
inflow minus outflow. Similarly for tank T. From Fig. 78 we see that

Hence the mathematical model of our mixture problem is the system of first-order ODEs
yr (cid:2)(cid:3)0.02y (cid:4)0.02y (Tank T)
1 1 2 1
yr (cid:2) 0.02y (cid:3)0.02y (Tank T).

As a vector equation with column vector y(cid:2) 1 and matrix Athis becomes

(cid:3)0.02 0.02
yr(cid:2)Ay, where A(cid:2) .
c 0.02 (cid:3)0.02d
Step 2. General solution.As for a single equation, we try an exponential function of t,
(1) y(cid:2)xelt. Then yr(cid:2)lxelt(cid:2)Axelt.
Dividing the last equation lxelt(cid:2)Axeltby eltand interchanging the left and right sides, we obtain
Ax(cid:2)lx.
We need nontrivial solutions (solutions that are not identically zero). Hence we have to look for eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of A. The eigenvalues are the solutions of the characteristic equation
(cid:3)0.02(cid:3)l 0.02
(2) det (A(cid:3)lI)(cid:2) (cid:2)((cid:3)0.02(cid:3)l)2(cid:3)0.022(cid:2)l(l(cid:4)0.04)(cid:2)0.
0.02 (cid:3)0.02(cid:3)l
We see that l (cid:2)0(which can very well happen—don’t get mixed up—it is eigenvectorsthat must not be zero)
1
and l (cid:2)(cid:3)0.04. Eigenvec2tors are obtained from (14*2)in Sec. 4.0 with l(cid:2)0and l(cid:2)(cid:3)0.04. For our present
2
Athis gives [we need only the first equation in (14*)]
(cid:3)0.02x (cid:4)0.02x (cid:2)0 and ((cid:3)0.02(cid:4)0.04)x (cid:4)0.02x (cid:2)0,

respectively. Hence x (cid:2)x and x (cid:2)(cid:3)x , respectively, and we can take x (cid:2)x (cid:2)1and x (cid:2)(cid:3)x (cid:2)1.
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
This gives two eigenvectors corresponding to l (cid:2)0and l (cid:2)(cid:3)0.04, respectively, namely,

1 1
x(1)(cid:2) and x(2)(cid:2) .

where c and c are arbitrary constants. Later we shall call this a general solution.
1 2
Step 3. Use of initial conditions. The initial conditions are y (0)(cid:2)0(no fertilizer in tank T) and y (0)(cid:2)150.
1 1 2
From this and (3) with t(cid:2)0we obtain

In components this is c (cid:4) c (cid:2)0, c (cid:3) c (cid:2)150. The solution is c (cid:2)75, c (cid:2)(cid:3)75. This gives the answer

1 1
y (cid:2)75(cid:4)75e(cid:3)0.04t (Tank T, upper curve).
2 2
Figure 78 shows the exponential increase of y and the exponential decrease of y to the common limit 75 lb.
1 2
Did you expect this for physical reasons? Can you physically explain why the curves look “symmetric”? Would
the limit change if T initially contained 100 lb of fertilizer and T contained 50 lb?
1 2
Step 4. Answer.T contains half the fertilizer amount of T if it contains 1 3of the total amount, that is,
1 2 >
50 lb. Thus
y (cid:2)75(cid:3)75e(cid:3)0.04t(cid:2)50, e(cid:3)0.04t(cid:2)1, t(cid:2)(ln 3) 0.04(cid:2)27.5.

Division by 10 and differentiation gives Ir (cid:3)0.4Ir (cid:4)0.4I (cid:2)0.

To simplify the solution process, we first get rid of 0.4Ir , which by (4a) equals 0.4((cid:3)4I (cid:4)4I (cid:4)12).

Substitution into the present ODE gives
Ir (cid:2)0.4Ir (cid:3)0.4I (cid:2)0.4((cid:3)4I (cid:4)4I (cid:4)12)(cid:3)0.4I

Step 2.Solving (5). Because of the vector gthis is a nonhomogeneous system, and we try to proceed as for a
single ODE, solving first the homogeneous system Jr(cid:2)AJ(thus Jr(cid:3)AJ(cid:2)0) by substituting J(cid:2)xelt. This
gives
Jr(cid:2)lxelt(cid:2)Axelt, hence Ax(cid:2)lx.
Hence, to obtain a nontrivial solution, we again need the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For the present matrix
Athey are derived in Example 1 in Sec. 4.0:

l (cid:2)(cid:3)2, x(1)(cid:2) ; l (cid:2)(cid:3)0.8, x(2)(cid:2) .

Hence a “general solution” of the homogeneous system is
J (cid:2)c x(1)e(cid:3)2t(cid:4)c x(2)e(cid:3)0.8t.

For a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous system (5), since g is constant, we try a constant column
vector J (cid:2)awith components a , a . Then Jr (cid:2)0, and substitution into (5) gives Aa(cid:4)g(cid:2)0; in components,

Now comes an important idea, on which we shall elaborate further, beginning in Sec. 4.3. Figure 80a shows
I (t)and I (t)as two separate curves. Figure 80b shows these two currents as a single curve [I (t), I (t)]in the
1 2 1 2
I I -plane. This is a parametric representation with time t as the parameter. It is often important to know in
12
which sense such a curve is traced. This can be indicated by an arrow in the sense of increasing t, as is shown.
The I I -plane is called the phase planeof our system (5), and the curve in Fig. 80b is called a trajectory. We
12
shall see that such “phase plane representations”are far more important than graphs as in Fig. 80a because
they will give a much better qualitative overall impression of the general behavior of whole families of solutions,
not merely of one solution as in the present case. (cid:2)

Remark. In both examples, by growing the dimension of the problem (from one tank to
two tanks or one circuit to two circuits) we also increased the number of ODEs (from one
ODE to two ODEs). This “growth” in the problem being reflected by an “increase” in the
mathematical model is attractive and affirms the quality of our mathematical modeling and
theory.
Conversion of an nth-Order ODE to a System
We show that an nth-order ODE of the general form (8) (see Theorem 1) can be converted
to a system of n first-order ODEs. This is practically and theoretically important—
practically because it permits the study and solution of single ODEs by methods for
systems, and theoretically because it opens a way of including the theory of higher order
ODEs into that of first-order systems. This conversion is another reason for the importance
of systems, in addition to their use as models in various basic applications. The idea of
the conversion is simple and straightforward, as follows.

THEOREM 1 Conversion of an ODE
An nth-order ODE

can be converted to a system of n first-order ODEs by setting

It agrees with that in Sec. 2.4. For an illustrative computation, let m(cid:2)1,c(cid:2)2, and k(cid:2)0.75. Then

which is (cid:3)lx (cid:4)x (cid:2)0. For l this gives 0.5x (cid:4)x (cid:2)0, say, x (cid:2)2, x (cid:2)(cid:3)1. For l (cid:2)(cid:3)1.5it gives

Basic Theory of Systems of ODEs.

In this section we discuss some basic concepts and facts about system of ODEs that are
quite similar to those for single ODEs.

We can write the system (1) as a vector equation by introducing the column vectors
y(cid:2)[y Á y ]T and f(cid:2)[f Á f ]T (where T means transposition and saves us
1 n 1 n
the space that would be needed for writing y and f as columns). This gives
(1) yr (cid:2)f(t, y).
This system (1) includes almost all cases of practical interest. For n(cid:2)1 it becomes
yr (cid:2)f (t, y ) or, simply, yr (cid:2)f(t, y), well known to us from Chap. 1.
1 1 1
A solution of (1) on some interval a(cid:7)t(cid:7)b is a set of n differentiable functions

“solution vector” h(cid:2)[h Á h ]T (a column vector!) we can write
1 n
y(cid:2)h(t).

SEC. 4.2 Basic Theory of Systems of ODEs. Wronskian 139
The general theory of linear systems of ODEs is quite similar to that of a single linear
ODE in Secs. 2.6 and 2.7. To see this, we explain the most basic concepts and facts. For
proofs we refer to more advanced texts, such as [A7].
Basis. General Solution. Wronskian
By a basisor a fundamentalsystemof solutions of the homogeneous system (4) on some
interval J we mean a linearly independent set of n solutions y(1),Á , y(n) of (4) on that
interval. (We write Jbecause we need Ito denote the unit matrix.) We call a corresponding
linear combination
(5) y(cid:2)c y(1)Á(cid:4)c y(n) (c ,Á , c arbitrary)
1 n 1 n
a general solution of (4) on J. It can be shown that if the a (t) in (4) are continuous on
jk
J, then (4) has a basis of solutions on J, hence a general solution, which includes every
solution of (4) on J.
We can write nsolutions y(1),Á , y(n)of (4) on some interval Jas columns of an n(cid:5)n
matrix
(6) Y(cid:2)[y(1) Á y(n)].
The determinant of Y is called the Wronskian of y(1),Á , y(n), written
y(1) y(2) Á y(n)
1 1 1
y(1) y(2) Á y(n)
(7) W(y(1),Á , y(n))(cid:2) 2 2 2 .
# # Á #
y(1) y(2) Á y(n)
n n n
5 5
The columns are these solutions, each in terms of components. These solutions form a
basis on J if and only if W is not zero at any t in this interval. W is either identically
1
zero or nowhere zero in J. (This is similar to Secs. 2.6 and 3.1.)
If the solutions y(1),Á , y(n) in (5) form a basis (a fundamental system), then (6) is
often called a fundamental matrix. Introducing a column vector c(cid:2)[c c Á c ]T,
1 2 n
we can now write (5) simply as
(8) y(cid:2)Yc.
Furthermore, we can relate (7) to Sec. 2.6, as follows. If y and z are solutions of a
second-order homogeneous linear ODE, their Wronskian is
y z
W(y, z) (cid:2) .
r r
y z
To write this ODE as a system, we have to set y(cid:2)y , yr (cid:2)yr (cid:2)y and similarly for z
1 1 2
(see Sec. 4.1). But then W(y, z) becomes (7), 2except 2for notation.

Continuing, we now assume that our homogeneous linear system
(1) y(cid:5)(cid:2)Ay
under discussion has constant coefficients,so that the n(cid:5)nmatrix A(cid:2)[a ]has entries
jk
not depending on t. We want to solve (1). Now a single ODE yr (cid:2)ky has the solution
y(cid:2)Cekt. So let us try
(2) y(cid:2)xelt.
Substitution into (1) gives yr (cid:2)lxelt(cid:2)Ay (cid:2)Axelt. Dividing by elt, we obtain the
eigenvalue problem
(3) Ax (cid:2)lx.
Thus the nontrivial solutions of (1) (solutions that are not zero vectors) are of the form
(2), where l is an eigenvalue of A and x is a corresponding eigenvector.
We assume that Ahas a linearly independent set of neigenvectors. This holds in most
applications, in particular if Ais symmetric (a (cid:2)a )or skew-symmetric (a (cid:2)(cid:3)a )

Let those eigenvectors be x(1),Á , x(n) and let them correspond to eigenvalues

1 n
corresponding solutions (2) are
(4) y(4)(cid:2)x(1)el 1t, Á , y(n)(cid:2)x(n)el nt.
Their Wronskian W(cid:2)W(y(1),Á , y(n)) [(7) in Sec. 4.2] is given by

On the right, the exponential function is never zero, and the determinant is not zero either
because its columns are the nlinearly independent eigenvectors. This proves the following
theorem, whose assumption is true if the matrix Ais symmetric or skew-symmetric, or if
the n eigenvalues of A are all different.

How to Graph Solutions in the Phase Plane
We shall now concentrate on systems (1) with constant coefficients consisting of two
ODEs
yr (cid:2)a y (cid:4)a y
1 11 1 12 2
(6) y(cid:5)(cid:2)Ay; in components,
yr (cid:2)a y (cid:4)a y .
2 21 1 22 2
Of course, we can graph solutions of (6),
y (t)
1
(7) y(t)(cid:2) ,
cy (t)d
2
as two curves over the t-axis, one for each component of y(t). (Figure 80a in Sec. 4.1 shows
an example.) But we can also graph (7) as a single curve in the y y -plane. This is a parametric
1 2
representation (parametric equation) with parameter t. (See Fig. 80b for an example. Many
more follow. Parametric equations also occur in calculus.) Such a curve is called a trajectory
(or sometimes an orbitor path) of (6). The y y -plane is called the phase plane.1If we fill
1 2
the phase plane with trajectories of (6), we obtain the so-called phase portraitof (6).
Studies of solutions in the phase plane have become quite important, along with
advances in computer graphics, because a phase portrait gives a good general qualitative
impression of the entire family of solutions. Consider the following example, in which
we develop such a phase portrait.

The use of the phase plane is a qualitative method, a method of obtaining general qualitative information
on solutions without actually solving an ODE or a system. This method was created by HENRI POINCARÉ
(1854–1912), a great French mathematician, whose work was also fundamental in complex analysis, divergent
series, topology, and astronomy.

Solution. By substituting y(cid:2)xeltand yr(cid:2)lxeltand dropping the exponential function we get Ax(cid:2)lx.
The characteristic equation is
(cid:3)3(cid:3)l 1
det (A(cid:3)lI)(cid:2) (cid:2)l2(cid:4)6l(cid:4)8(cid:2)0.
1 (cid:3)3(cid:3)l
This gives the eigenvalues l (cid:2)(cid:3)2and l (cid:2)(cid:3)4. Eigenvectors are then obtained from
1 2
2 2
((cid:3)3(cid:3)l)x (cid:4)x (cid:2)0.
1 2
For l (cid:2)(cid:3)2this is (cid:3)x (cid:4)x (cid:2)0. Hence we can take x(1)(cid:2)[1 1]T. For l (cid:2)(cid:3)4this becomes x (cid:4)x (cid:2)0,
1 1 2 2 1 2
and an eigenvector is x(2)(cid:2)[1 (cid:3)1]T. This gives the general solution
y 1 1

Figure 82 shows a phase portrait of some of the trajectories (to which more trajectories could be added if so
desired). The two straight trajectories correspond to c (cid:2)0 and c (cid:2)0 and the others to other choices of
1 2
c , c . (cid:2)
1 2
The method of the phase plane is particularly valuable in the frequent cases when solving
an ODE or a system is inconvenient of impossible.
Critical Points of the System (6)
The point y(cid:2)0 in Fig. 82 seems to be a common point of all trajectories, and we want
to explore the reason for this remarkable observation. The answer will follow by calculus.
Indeed, from (6) we obtain
dy yr dt yr a y (cid:4)a y
(9) dy2 (cid:2) y2 r
dt
(cid:2) y2 r (cid:2) a21 y1 (cid:4)a22 y2 .
1 1 1 11 1 12 2
This associates with every point P: (y , y ) a unique tangent direction dy dy of the
1 2 2> 1
trajectory passing through P, except for the point P(cid:2)P :(0, 0), where the right side of(9)
0
becomes 0 0. This point P, at which dy dy becomes undetermined, is called a critical
> 0 2> 1
point of (6).
Five Types of Critical Points
There are five types of critical points depending on the geometric shape of the trajectories
near them. They are called improper nodes, proper nodes, saddle points, centers, and
spiral points. We define and illustrate them in Examples 1–5.
EXAMPLE 1 (Continued) Improper Node (Fig. 82)
An improper node is a critical point P at which all the trajectories, except for two of them, have the same
0
limiting direction of the tangent. The two exceptional trajectories also have a limiting direction of the tangent
at P which, however, is different.
0
The system (8) has an improper node at 0, as its phase portrait Fig. 82 shows. The common limiting direction
at 0is that of the eigenvector x(1)(cid:2)[1 1]Tbecause e(cid:3)4tgoes to zero faster than e(cid:3)2tas tincreases. The two
exceptional limiting tangent directions are those of x(2)(cid:2)[1 (cid:3)1]Tand (cid:3)x(2)(cid:2)[(cid:3)1 1]T. (cid:2)

A proper node is a critical point P at which every trajectory has a definite limiting direction and for any given
0
direction dat P there is a trajectory having das its limiting direction.

1
l (cid:2)(cid:3)1. For l(cid:2)1 an eigenvector [1 0]T is obtained from the second row of (A(cid:3)lI)x(cid:2)0, that is,
2
0x (cid:4)((cid:3)1(cid:3)1)x (cid:2)0. For l (cid:2)(cid:3)1the first row gives [0 1]T. Hence a general solution is

has a center at the origin. The characteristic equation l2(cid:4)4(cid:2)0gives the eigenvalues 2i and (cid:3)2i. For 2ian
eigenvector follows from the first equation (cid:3)2ix (cid:4)x (cid:2)0of (A(cid:3)lI)x(cid:2)0, say, [1 2i]T. For l(cid:2)(cid:3)2ithat
1 2
equation is (cid:3)((cid:3)2i)x (cid:4)x (cid:2)0and gives, say, [1 (cid:3)2i]T. Hence a complex general solution is

A real solution is obtained from (12*) by the Euler formula or directly from (12) by a trick. (Remember the
trick and call it a method when you apply it again.) Namely, the left side of (a) times the right side of (b) is
(cid:3)4y yr . This must equal the left side of (b) times the right side of (a). Thus,
1 1
(cid:3)4y yr(cid:2)y yr . By integration, 2y2(cid:4)1y2(cid:2)const.

has a spiral point at the origin, as we shall see. The characteristic equation is l2(cid:4)2l(cid:4)2(cid:2)0. It gives the
eigenvalues (cid:3)1(cid:4)i and (cid:3)1(cid:3)i. Corresponding eigenvectors are obtained from ((cid:3)1(cid:3)l)x (cid:4)x (cid:2)0. For
1 2
c04.qxd 10/27/10 9:32 PM Page 145
SEC. 4.3 Constant-Coefficient Systems. Phase Plane Method 145
l(cid:2)(cid:3)1(cid:4)ithis becomes (cid:3)ix (cid:4)x (cid:2)0and we can take [1 i]Tas an eigenvector. Similarly, an eigenvector
1 2
corresponding to (cid:3)1(cid:3)iis [1 (cid:3)i]T. This gives the complex general solution
1 1
y(cid:2)c e((cid:3)1(cid:6)i)t(cid:4)c e((cid:3)1(cid:3)i)t.
1 cid 2 c(cid:3)id
The next step would be the transformation of this complex solution to a real general solution by the Euler
formula. But, as in the last example, we just wanted to see what eigenvalues to expect in the case of a spiral
point. Accordingly, we start again from the beginning and instead of that rather lengthy systematic calculation
we use a shortcut. We multiply the first equation in (13) by y , the second by y , and add, obtaining
1 2
y yr (cid:4) y yr (cid:2)(cid:3)(y2(cid:4)y2).
1 1 2 2 1 2
We now introduce polar coordinates r, t, where r2(cid:2)y2(cid:4)y2. Differentiating this with respect to t gives
1 2
2rrr(cid:2)2y yr (cid:4)2y yr . Hence the previous equation can be written
1 1 2 2
rrr(cid:2)(cid:3)r2, Thus, rr(cid:2)(cid:3)r, dr r(cid:2)(cid:3)dt, ln ƒrƒ (cid:2)(cid:3)t(cid:4)c*, r(cid:2)ce(cid:3)t.

It has a double root l(cid:2)3. Hence eigenvectors are obtained from (4(cid:3)l)x (cid:4)x (cid:2)0, thus from x (cid:4)x (cid:2)0,
1 2 1 2
say, x(1)(cid:2)[1 (cid:3)1]Tand nonzero multiples of it (which do not help). The method now is to substitute
y(2)(cid:2)xtelt(cid:4)uelt
with constant u(cid:2)[u u ]Tinto (14). (The xt-term alone, the analog of what we did in Sec. 2.2 in the case
1 2
of a double root, would not be enough. Try it.) This gives
y(2)r(cid:2)xelt(cid:4)lxtelt(cid:4)luelt(cid:2)Ay(2)(cid:2)Axtelt(cid:4)Auelt.
On the right, Ax(cid:2)lx. Hence the terms lxteltcancel, and then division by eltgives

The critical point at the origin is often called a degenerate node. c y(1) gives the heavy straight line, with

Criteria for Critical Points. Stability
We continue our discussion of homogeneous linear systems with constant coefficients (1).
Let us review where we are. From Sec. 4.3 we have
a a yr (cid:2)a y (cid:4) a y
(1) yr (cid:2)Ay (cid:2) 11 12 y, in components, 1 11 1 12 2
ca a d yr (cid:2)a y (cid:4) a y .
21 22 2 21 1 22 2
From the examples in the last section, we have seen that we can obtain an overview of
families of solution curves if we represent them parametrically as y(t)(cid:2)[y (t) y (t)]T
1 2
and graph them as curves in the y y -plane, called the phase plane. Such a curve is called
1 2
a trajectory of (1), and their totality is known as the phase portrait of (1).
Now we have seen that solutions are of the form
y(t)(cid:2)xelt. Substitution into (1) gives yr (t)(cid:2)lxelt(cid:2)Ay(cid:2)Axelt.
Dropping the common factor elt, we have
(2) Ax (cid:2)lx.
Hence y(t)is a (nonzero) solution of (1) if lis an eigenvalue of Aand xa corresponding
eigenvector.
Our examples in the last section show that the general form of the phase portrait is
determined to a large extent by the type of critical point of the system (1) defined as a
point at which dy dy becomes undetermined, 0 0; here [see (9) in Sec. 4.3]

We also recall from Sec. 4.3 that there are various types of critical points.
What is now new, is that we shall see how these types of critical points are related
tothe eigenvalues. The latter are solutions l(cid:2)l and l of the characteristic equation

Furthermore, the product representation of the equation gives

Stability
Critical points may also be classified in terms of their stability. Stability concepts are basic
in engineering and other applications. They are suggested by physics, where stability
means, roughly speaking, that a small change (a small disturbance) of a physical system
at some instant changes the behavior of the system only slightly at all future times t. For
critical points, the following concepts are appropriate.
DEFINITIONS Stable, Unstable, Stable and Attractive
A critical point P of (1) is called stable2 if, roughly, all trajectories of (1) that at
0
some instant are close to P remain close to P at all future times; precisely: if for
0 0
every disk D of radius P(cid:10)0with center P there is a disk D of radius d(cid:10)0with
P 0 d
center P such that every trajectory of (1) that has a point P (corresponding to t(cid:2)t ,
0 1 1
say) in D has all its points corresponding to t(cid:12)t in D . See Fig. 90.
d 1 P
P is called unstable if P is not stable.
0 0
P is called stable and attractive (or asymptotically stable) if P is stable and
0 0
every trajectory that has a point in D approaches P as t:(cid:9). See Fig. 91.
d 0
Classification criteria for critical points in terms of stability are given in Table 4.2. Both
tables are summarized in the stability chart in Fig. 92. In this chart region of instability
is dark blue.
2In the sense of the Russian mathematician ALEXANDER MICHAILOVICH LJAPUNOV (1857–1918),
whose work was fundamental in stability theory for ODEs. This is perhaps the most appropriate definition of

We indicate how the criteria in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 are obtained. If q(cid:2)l l (cid:10)0, both
1 2
of the eigenvalues are positive or both are negative or complex conjugates. If also
p(cid:2)l (cid:4)l (cid:7)0, both are negative or have a negative real part. Hence P is stable and
1 2 0
attractive. The reasoning for the other two lines in Table 4.2 is similar.
If ¢ (cid:7)0, the eigenvalues are complex conjugates, say, l (cid:2)a(cid:4)iband l (cid:2) a(cid:3)ib.
1 2
If also p(cid:2)l (cid:4)l (cid:2)2a(cid:7)0, this gives a spiral point that is stable and attractive. If
1 2
p(cid:2)2a(cid:10)0, this gives an unstable spiral point.
If p(cid:2)0, then l (cid:2)(cid:3)l and q(cid:2)l l (cid:2)(cid:3)l2. If also q(cid:10)0, then l2(cid:2)(cid:3)q(cid:7)0, so
2 1 1 2 1 1
that l , and thus l , must be pure imaginary. This gives periodic solutions, their trajectories

being closed curves around P, which is a center.

Qualitative Methods for Nonlinear Systems
Qualitative methods are methods of obtaining qualitative information on solutions
without actually solving a system. These methods are particularly valuable for systems
whose solution by analytic methods is difficult or impossible. This is the case for many
practically important nonlinear systems
yr (cid:2)f (y , y )
(1) yr (cid:2)f(y), thus 1 1 1 2
yr (cid:2)f (y , y ).
2 2 1 2
In this section we extend phase plane methods,as just discussed, from linear systems
to nonlinear systems (1). We assume that (1) is autonomous, that is, the independent
variable t does not occur explicitly. (All examples in the last section are autonomous.)
We shall again exhibit entire families of solutions. This is an advantage over numeric
methods, which give only one (approximate) solution at a time.
Concepts needed from the last section are the phase plane (the y y -plane),trajectories
1 2
(solution curves of (1) in the phase plane), the phase portrait of (1) (the totality of these
trajectories), and critical points of (1) (points (y , y ) at which both f (y , y )and f (y , y )
1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2
are zero).
Now (1) may have several critical points. Our approach shall be to discuss one critical
point after another. If a critical point P is not at the origin, then, for technical
0
convenience, we shall move this point to the origin before analyzing the point. More
formally, if P: (a, b)is a critical point with (a, b) not at the origin (0, 0), then we apply
0
the translation
~ y (cid:2)y (cid:3)a, ~ y (cid:2)y (cid:3)b
1 1 2 2
which moves P to (0, 0) as desired. Thus we can assume P to be the origin (0, 0), and
0 0
~ ~
for simplicity we continue to write y , y (instead of y , y ). We also assume that P is
1 2 1 2 0
isolated,that is, it is the only critical point of (1) within a (sufficiently small) disk with
center at the origin. If (1) has only finitely many critical points, that is automatically
true. (Explain!)
Linearization of Nonlinear Systems
How can we determine the kind and stability property of a critical point P: (0, 0) of
0
(1)? In most cases this can be done by linearization of (1) near P, writing (1) as
0
yr (cid:2)f(y)(cid:2)Ay (cid:4)h(y) and dropping h(y), as follows.
Since P is critical, f (0, 0) (cid:2)0, f (0, 0) (cid:2)0, so that f and f have no constant terms
0 1 2 1 2
and we can write
yr (cid:2)a y (cid:4)a y (cid:4)h (y , y )
(2) yr (cid:2)Ay (cid:4)h(y), thus 1 11 1 12 2 1 1 2
yr (cid:2)a y (cid:4)a y (cid:4)h (y , y ).
2 21 1 22 2 2 1 2
A is constant (independent of t) since (1) is autonomous. One can prove the following
(proof in Ref. [A7], pp. 375–388, listed in App. 1).
c04.qxd 11/9/10 7:23 PM Page 153
SEC. 4.5 Qualitative Methods for Nonlinear Systems 153
THEOREM 1 Linearization
If f and f in (1) are continuous and have continuous partial derivatives in a
1 2
neighborhood of the critical point P: (0, 0), and if det A(cid:7)0 in (2), then the kind
0
and stability of the critical point of (1) are the same as those of the linearized
system
yr (cid:2)a y (cid:3)a y
(3) yr (cid:2)Ay, thus 1 11 1 12 2
yr (cid:2)a y (cid:3)a y .
2 21 1 22 2
Exceptions occur if Ahas equal or pure imaginary eigenvalues; then (1)may have
the same kind of critical point as (3) or a spiral point.
EXAMPLE 1 Free Undamped Pendulum. Linearization
Figure 93a shows a pendulum consisting of a body of mass m (the bob) and a rod of length L. Determine the
locations and types of the critical points. Assume that the mass of the rod and air resistance are negligible.
Solution. Step 1. Setting up the mathematical model. Let u denote the angular displacement, measured
counterclockwise from the equilibrium position. The weight of the bob is mg(gthe acceleration of gravity). It
causes a restoring force mg sin utangent to the curve of motion (circular arc) of the bob. By Newton’s second
law, at each instant this force is balanced by the force of acceleration
mLus
, where
Lus
is the acceleration;
hence the resultant of these two forces is zero, and we obtain as the mathematical model
mLus(cid:3)mg sin u(cid:2)0.
Dividing this by mL, we have
g
(4) us(cid:3)k sin u(cid:2)0 k(cid:2) .
a Lb
When uis very small, we can approximate sin urather accurately by uand obtain as an approximate solution
A cos 1kt(cid:3)B sin 1kt, but the exact solution for any uis not an elementary function.
Step 2. Critical points (0, 0), ((cid:2)2(cid:3), 0), ((cid:2)4(cid:3), 0),Á , Linearization. To obtain a system of ODEs, we set
u(cid:2)y , ur(cid:2)y . Then from (4) we obtain a nonlinear system (1) of the form
1 2
yr (cid:2)f (y , y )(cid:2)y
1 1 1 2 2
(4*)
yr (cid:2)f (y , y )(cid:2)(cid:4)k sin y .
2 2 1 2 1
The right sides are both zero when y (cid:2)0and sin y (cid:2)0. This gives infinitely many critical points (np, 0),
where n(cid:2)0, (cid:5)1, (cid:5)2, Á . We consid2 er (0, 0). Since1 the Maclaurin series is
sin y (cid:2)y (cid:4) 1y3(cid:3)(cid:4)Á (cid:2)y ,
1 1 6 1 1
the linearized system at (0, 0)is
0 1 yr (cid:2)y
yr(cid:2)Ay(cid:2)
y, thus
1 2
c(cid:4)k 0d yr (cid:2)(cid:4)ky .
2 1
To apply our criteria in Sec. 4.4 we calculate p(cid:2)a (cid:3)a (cid:2)0, q(cid:2)det A(cid:2)k(cid:2)g L ((cid:6)0), and
11 22 >
¢(cid:2)p2(cid:4)4q (cid:2)(cid:4)4k. From this and Table 4.1(c) in Sec. 4.4 we conclude that (0, 0)is a center, which is always
stable. Since sin u(cid:2)sin y is periodic with period 2p, the critical points (np, 0), n(cid:2)(cid:5)2, (cid:5)4,Á , are all centers.

Step 3. Critical points((cid:2)(cid:3), 0), ((cid:2)3(cid:3), 0), ((cid:2)5(cid:3), 0),Á , Linearization. We now consider the critical point
(p, 0), setting u(cid:4)p(cid:2)y and (u(cid:4)p)r(cid:2)ur(cid:2)y . Then in (4),
1 2
sin u(cid:2)sin (y (cid:3)p)(cid:2)(cid:4)sin y (cid:2)(cid:4)y (cid:3)1y3(cid:4)(cid:3)Á (cid:2)(cid:4)y
1 1 1 6 1 1
c04.qxd 10/27/10 9:32 PM Page 154
154 CHAP. 4 Systems of ODEs. Phase Plane. Qualitative Methods
and the linearized system at (p, 0)is now
0 1 yr (cid:2)y
yr(cid:2)Ay(cid:2)
y, thus
1 2
ck 0d yr (cid:2)ky .
2 1
We see that p(cid:2)0, q(cid:2)(cid:3)k ((cid:7)0), and ¢(cid:2)(cid:3)4q(cid:2)4k. Hence, by Table 4.1(b), this gives a saddle point, which
is always unstable. Because of periodicity, the critical points (np, 0), n(cid:2)(cid:16)1, (cid:16)3,Á , are all saddle points.
These results agree with the impression we get from Fig. 93b. (cid:2)

EXAMPLE 2 Linearization of the Damped Pendulum Equation
To gain further experience in investigating critical points, as another practically important case, let us see how
Example 1 changes when we add a damping term
cur
(damping proportional to the angular velocity) to equation
(4), so that it becomes
(5) us(cid:4)cur(cid:4)k sin u(cid:2)0
where k(cid:10)0and c(cid:12)0(which includes our previous case of no damping, c(cid:2)0). Setting u(cid:2)y , ur(cid:2)y , as
1 2
before, we obtain the nonlinear system (use
us(cid:2)yr
)
2
yr (cid:2)y
1 2
yr (cid:2)(cid:3)k sin y (cid:3)cy .
2 1 2
We see that the critical points have the same locations as before, namely, (0, 0), ((cid:16)p, 0), ((cid:16)2p, 0),Á . We
consider (0, 0). Linearizing sin y (cid:4)y as in Example 1, we get the linearized system at (0, 0)
1 1
0 1 yr (cid:2)y
(6)
yr(cid:2)Ay(cid:2)
y, thus
1 2
c(cid:3)k (cid:3)cd yr (cid:2)(cid:3)ky (cid:3)cy .
2 1 2
This is identical with the system in Example 2 of Sec. 4.4, except for the (positive!) factor m (and except for
the physical meaning of y ). Hence for c(cid:2)0(no damping) we have a center (see Fig. 93b), for small damping
1
we have a spiral point (see Fig. 94), and so on.
We now consider the critical point (p, 0). We set u(cid:3)p(cid:2)y , (u(cid:3)p)r(cid:2)ur(cid:2)y and linearize
1 2
sin u(cid:2)sin (y (cid:4)p)(cid:2)(cid:3)sin y (cid:4)(cid:3)y .
1 1 1
This gives the new linearized system at (p, 0)
0 1 yr (cid:2)y
(6*)
yr(cid:2)Ay(cid:2)
y, thus
1 2

c04.qxd 10/27/10 9:33 PM Page 155
SEC. 4.5 Qualitative Methods for Nonlinear Systems 155
For our criteria in Sec. 4.4 we calculate p(cid:2)a (cid:4)a (cid:2)(cid:3)c, q(cid:2)det A(cid:2)(cid:3)k, and ¢(cid:2)p2(cid:3)4q(cid:2)c2(cid:4)4k.
11 22
This gives the following results for the critical point at (p, 0).
No damping. c(cid:2)0, p(cid:2)0, q(cid:7)0, ¢(cid:10)0, a saddle point. See Fig. 93b.
Damping.c(cid:10)0, p(cid:7)0, q(cid:7)0, ¢(cid:10)0, a saddle point. See Fig. 94.
Since sin y is periodic with period 2p, the critical points ((cid:16)2p, 0), ((cid:16)4p, 0),Á are of the same type as
(0, 0), and the1 critical points ((cid:3)p, 0), ((cid:16)3p, 0),Á are of the same type as (p, 0), so that our task is finished.
Figure 94 shows the trajectories in the case of damping. What we see agrees with our physical intuition.
Indeed, damping means loss of energy. Hence instead of the closed trajectories of periodic solutions in
Fig.93bwe now have trajectories spiraling around one of the critical points (0, 0), ((cid:16)2p, 0),Á . Even the
wavy trajectories corresponding to whirly motions eventually spiral around one of these points. Furthermore,
there are no more trajectories that connect critical points (as there were in the undamped case for the saddle
points). (cid:2)

Lotka–Volterra Population Model
EXAMPLE 3 Predator–Prey Population Model3
This model concerns two species, say, rabbits and foxes, and the foxes prey on the rabbits.
Step 1. Setting up the model.We assume the following.
1. Rabbits have unlimited food supply. Hence, if there were no foxes, their number y (t) would grow
1
exponentially, yr (cid:2)ay .
1 1
2. Actually, y is decreased because of the kill by foxes, say, at a rate proportional to y y , where y (t)is
1 1 2 2
the number of foxes. Hence yr (cid:2)ay (cid:3)by y , where a(cid:10)0and b(cid:10)0.
1 1 1 2
3. If there were no rabbits, then y (t) would exponentially decrease to zero, yr (cid:2)(cid:3)ly . However, y is
2 2 2 2
increased by a rate proportional to the number of encounters between predator and prey; together we
have yr (cid:2)(cid:3)ly (cid:4)ky y , where k(cid:10)0and l(cid:10)0.

It can be shown, by a complicated analysis, that the nonlinear system (7) also has a center (rather than a spiral
point) at (l k, a b)surrounded by closed trajectories (not ellipses).

We see that the predators and prey have a cyclic variation about the critical point. Let us move counterclockwise
around the ellipse, beginning at the right vertex, where the rabbits have a maximum number. Foxes are sharply
increasing in number until they reach a maximum at the upper vertex, and the number of rabbits is then sharply
decreasing until it reaches a minimum at the left vertex, and so on. Cyclic variations of this kind have
beenobserved in nature, for example, for lynx and snowshoe hare near the Hudson Bay, with a cycle of about
10 years.

Transformation to a First-Order Equation
in the Phase Plane
Another phase plane method is based on the idea of transforming a second-order
autonomous ODE (an ODE in which t does not occur explicitly)
F(y, yr , ys )(cid:2)0
to first order by taking y(cid:2)y as the independent variable, setting yr (cid:2)y and transforming

y by the chain rule,
dy dy dy dy

and can sometimes be solved or treated by direction fields. We illustrate this for the
equation in Example 1 and shall gain much more insight into the behavior of solutions.
EXAMPLE 4 An ODE (8) for the Free Undamped Pendulum
If in (4) us(cid:4)k sin u(cid:2)0we set u(cid:2)y , ur(cid:2)y (the angular velocity) and use

2 2 1
Multiplying this by mL2, we get
1m(Ly )2(cid:3)mL2k cos y (cid:2)mL2C.
2 2 1
We see that these three terms are energies.Indeed, y is the angular velocity, so that Ly is the velocity and the
2 2
first term is the kinetic energy. The second term (including the minus sign) is the potential energy of the pendulum,
and mL2Cis its total energy, which is constant, as expected from the law of conservation of energy, because
there is no damping (no loss of energy). The type of motion depends on the total energy, hence on C, as follows.
Figure 93b shows trajectories for various values of C. These graphs continue periodically with period 2pto
the left and to the right. We see that some of them are ellipse-like and closed, others are wavy, and there are two
trajectories (passing through the saddle points (np, 0), n(cid:2)(cid:16)1, (cid:16)3,Á ) that separate those two types of
trajectories. From (9) we see that the smallest possible C is C(cid:2)(cid:3)k; then y (cid:2)0, and cos y (cid:2)1, so that the
2 1
pendulum is at rest. The pendulum will change its direction of motion if there are points at which y

Then k cos y (cid:4)C(cid:2)0 by (9). If y (cid:2)p, then cos y (cid:2)(cid:3)1 and C(cid:2)k. Hence if (cid:3)k(cid:7)C(cid:7)k, then the
1 1 1
pendulum reverses its direction for a ƒy ƒ (cid:2) ƒuƒ (cid:7)p, and for these values of C with ƒCƒ (cid:7)k the pendulum
1
oscillates. This corresponds to the closed trajectories in the figure. However, if C(cid:10)k, then y (cid:2)0is impossible
2
and the pendulum makes a whirly motion that appears as a wavy trajectory in the y y -plane. Finally, the value
1 2
C(cid:2)kcorresponds to the two “separating trajectories” in Fig. 93b connecting the saddle points. (cid:2)
The phase plane method of deriving a single first-order equation (8) may be of practical
interest not only when (8) can be solved (as in Example 4) but also when a solution

is not possible and we have to utilize fields (Sec. 1.2). We illustrate this with a very
famous example:
EXAMPLE 5 Self-Sustained Oscillations. Van der Pol Equation
There are physical systems such that for small oscillations, energy is fed into the system, whereas for large
oscillations, energy is taken from the system. In other words, large oscillations will be damped, whereas for
small oscillations there is “negative damping” (feeding of energy into the system). For physical reasons we
expect such a system to approach a periodic behavior, which will thus appear as a closed trajectory in the phase
plane, called a limit cycle.A differential equation describing such vibrations is the famous van der Pol equation4
(10) ys(cid:3)(cid:2)(1(cid:3)y2)yr(cid:4)y(cid:2)0 ((cid:2)(cid:10)0, constant).
It first occurred in the study of electrical circuits containing vacuum tubes. For (cid:2)(cid:2)0this equation becomes
ys(cid:4)y(cid:2)0 and we obtain harmonic oscillations. Let (cid:2)(cid:10)0. The damping term has the factor (cid:3)(cid:2)(1(cid:3)y2).
This is negative for small oscillations, when y2(cid:7)1, so that we have “negative damping,” is zero for y2(cid:2)1
(no damping), and is positive if y2(cid:10)1(positive damping, loss of energy). If (cid:2)is small, we expect a limit cycle
that is almost a circle because then our equation differs but little from ys(cid:4)y(cid:2)0. If (cid:2)is large, the limit cycle
will probably look different.
Setting y(cid:2)y , yr(cid:2)y and using ys(cid:2)(dy dy )y as in (8), we have from (10)

Figure 96 shows some isoclines when (cid:2)is small, (cid:2)(cid:2)0.1, the limit cycle (almost a circle), and two (blue) trajectories
approaching it, one from the outside and the other from the inside, of which only the initial portion, a small spiral,is
shown. Due to this approach by trajectories, a limit cycle differs conceptually from a closed curve (atrajectory)
surrounding a center, which is not approached by trajectories. For larger (cid:2)the limit cycle no longer resembles a
circle, and the trajectories approach it more rapidly than for smaller (cid:2). Figure 97 illustrates this for(cid:2)(cid:2)1. (cid:2)

Nonhomogeneous Linear Systems of ODEs
In this section, the last one of Chap. 4, we discuss methods for solving nonhomogeneous
linear systems of ODEs
(1) y(cid:5)(cid:2)Ay (cid:4)g (see Sec. 4.2)
where the vector g(t) is not identically zero. We assume g(t) and the entries of the
n(cid:5)n matrix A(t) to be continuous on some interval J of the t-axis. From a general
solution y(h)(t) of the homogeneous system yr (cid:2)Ay on J and a particular solution
y(p)(t) of (1) on J [i.e., a solution of (1) containing no arbitrary constants], we get a
solution of (1),
(2) y(cid:2)y(h)(cid:4)y(p).
y is called a general solution of (1) on J because it includes every solution of (1) on J.
This follows from Theorem 2 in Sec. 4.2 (see Prob. 1 of this section).
Having studied homogeneous linear systems in Secs. 4.1–4.4, our present task will be
to explain methods for obtaining particular solutions of (1). We discuss the method of

was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.

undetermined coefficients and the method of the variation of parameters; these have
counterparts for a single ODE, as we know from Secs. 2.7 and 2.10.
Method of Undetermined Coefficients
Just as for a single ODE, this method is suitable if the entries of A are constants and
the components of g are constants, positive integer powers of t, exponential functions,
or cosines and sines. In such a case a particular solution y(p)is assumed in a form similar
to g; for instance, y(p)(cid:2)u(cid:4)vt (cid:4)wt2 if g has components quadratic in t, with u, v,
w to be determined by substitution into (1). This is similar to Sec. 2.7, except for the
Modification Rule. It suffices to show this by an example.

(4) y(h)(cid:2)c e(cid:3)2t(cid:4) c e(cid:3)4t.
1c1d 2c(cid:3)1d
Since l(cid:2)(cid:3)2is an eigenvalue of A,the function e(cid:3)2ton the right side also appears in y(h), and we must apply
the Modification Rule by setting
y(p)(cid:2)ute(cid:3)2t(cid:4)ve(cid:3)2t (rather than ue(cid:3)2t).
Note that the first of these two terms is the analog of the modification in Sec. 2.7, but it would not be sufficient
here. (Try it.) By substitution,
y(p)r(cid:2)ue(cid:3)2t(cid:3)2ute(cid:3)2t(cid:3)2ve(cid:3)2t(cid:2)Aute(cid:3)2t(cid:4)Ave(cid:3)2t(cid:4)g.
Equating the te(cid:3)2t-terms on both sides, we have (cid:3)2u(cid:2)Au. Hence u is an eigenvector of A corresponding to
l(cid:2)(cid:3)2; thus [see (5)] u(cid:2)a[1 1]Twith any a(cid:6)0. Equating the other terms gives

Method of Variation of Parameters
This method can be applied to nonhomogeneous linear systems
(6) yr (cid:2)A(t)y(cid:4)g(t)
with variable A(cid:2)A(t)and general g(t). It yields a particular solution y(p)of (6) on some
open interval J on the t-axis if a general solution of the homogeneous system yr (cid:2)A(t)y
on J is known. We explain the method in terms of the previous example.

Solution. A basis of solutions of the homogeneous system is [e(cid:3)2t e(cid:3)2t]T and [e(cid:3)4t (cid:3)e(cid:3)4t]T. Hence

Here, Y(t)(cid:2)[y(1) y(2)]Tis the fundamental matrix (see Sec. 4.2). As in Sec. 2.10 we replace the constant

y(p)(cid:2)Y(t)u(t).

Now since y(1)and y(2)are solutions of the homogeneous system, we have
y(1)r(cid:2)Ay(1), y(2)r(cid:2)Ay(2),
thus
Yr(cid:2)AY.
Hence Yr u(cid:2)AYu, so that (8) reduces to
Yur(cid:2)g.
The solution is
ur(cid:2)Y(cid:3)1g;
here we use that the inverse Y(cid:3)1of Y(Sec. 4.0) exists because the determinant of Yis the Wronskian W, which
is not zero for a basis. Equation (9) in Sec. 4.0 gives the form of Y(cid:3)1,

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Systems of ODEs. Phase Plane. Qualitative Methods
Whereas single electric circuits or single mass–spring systems are modeled by
single ODEs (Chap. 2), networks of several circuits, systems of several masses
and springs, and other engineering problems lead to systems of ODEs, involving
Á
several unknown functions y (t), , y (t). Of central interest are first-order

this summary we let n(cid:2)2, so that

Then we can represent solution curves as trajectories in the phase plane (the
y y -plane), investigate their totality [the “phase portrait” of (1)], and study the kind
1 2
and stability of the critical points (points at which both f and f are zero), and
1 2
classify them as nodes, saddle points, centers,orspiral points(Secs. 4.3, 4.4). These
phase plane methods are qualitative; with their use we can discover various general
properties of solutions without actually solving the system. They are primarily used
for autonomous systems, that is, systems in which t does not occur explicitly.
A linear system is of the form

(These l’s are called the eigenvalues and these vectors x eigenvectors of the
matrix A. Further explanation is given in Sec. 4.0.)
A system (2) with g(cid:6)0 is called nonhomogeneous. Its general solution is of
the form y(cid:2)y (cid:4)y , where y is a general solution of (3) and y a particular

solution of (2). Methods of determining the latter are discussed in Sec. 4.6.
The discussion of critical points of linear systems based on eigenvalues is
summarized in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 in Sec. 4.4. It also applies to nonlinear systems
if the latter are first linearized. The key theorem for this is Theorem 1 in Sec. 4.5,
which also includes three famous applications, namely the pendulum and van der
Pol equations and the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey population model.

Series Solutions of ODEs.
Special Functions
In the previous chapters, we have seen that linear ODEs with constantcoefficientscan be
solved by algebraic methods, and that their solutions are elementary functions known from
calculus. For ODEs with variablecoefficientsthe situation is more complicated, and their
solutions may be nonelementary functions. Legendre’s, Bessel’s, and the hypergeometric
equations are important ODEs of this kind. Since these ODEs and their solutions, the
Legendre polynomials,Bessel functions, and hypergeometric functions, play an important
role in engineering modeling, we shall consider the two standard methods for solving
such ODEs.
The first method is called the power series method because it gives solutions in the
form of a power series a (cid:2)a x(cid:2)a x2(cid:2)a x3(cid:2) Á .
0 1 2 3
The second method is called the Frobenius method and generalizes the first; it gives
solutions in power series, multiplied by a logarithmic term ln x or a fractional power xr,
in cases such as Bessel’s equation, in which the first method is not general enough.
All those more advanced solutions and various other functions not appearing in calculus
are known as higher functions or special functions, which has become a technical term.
Each of these functions is important enough to give it a name and investigate its properties
and relations to other functions in great detail (take a look into Refs. [GenRef1],
[GenRef10], or[All] in App. 1). Your CAS knows practically all functions you will ever
need in industry or research labs, but it is up to you to find your way through this vast
terrain of formulas. The present chapter may give you some help in this task.
COMMENT. You can study this chapter directly after Chap. 2 because it needs no
material from Chaps. 3 or 4.

Power Series Method
The power series method is the standard method for solving linear ODEs with variable
coefficients. It gives solutions in the form of power series. These series can be used
for computing values, graphing curves, proving formulas, and exploring properties of
solutions, as we shall see. In this section we begin by explaining the idea of the power
series method.

From calculus we remember that a power series (in powers of x(cid:4)x ) is an infinite

series of the form
(cid:2)
(1) a a m(x(cid:4)x 0)m(cid:2)a 0(cid:3)a 1(x(cid:4)x 0)(cid:3)a 2(x(cid:4)x 0)2(cid:3) Á .

Á
Here, x is a variable. a , a , a , are constants, called the coefficients of the series.

x is a constant, called the centerof the series. In particular, if x (cid:2)0, we obtain a power
0 0
series in powers of x

(2) a a m xm(cid:2)a 0(cid:3)a 1x(cid:3)a 2 x2(cid:3)a 3 x3(cid:3) Á .
m(cid:2)0
We shall assume that all variables and constants are real.
We note that the term “power series” usually refers to a series of the form (1) [or (2)]
but does not include series of negative or fractional powers of x. We use m as the
summation letter, reserving nas a standard notation in the Legendre and Bessel equations
for integer values of the parameter.

Idea and Technique of the Power Series Method
The idea of the power series method for solving linear ODEs seems natural, once we
know that the most important ODEs in applied mathematics have solutions of this form.
We explain the idea by an ODE that can readily be solved otherwise.

into the ODE:
(a (cid:3)2a x(cid:3)3a x2(cid:3)Á )(cid:4)(a (cid:3)a x(cid:3)a x2(cid:3)Á )(cid:2)0.
1 2 3 0 1 2
Then we collect like powers of x, finding
(a (cid:4)a )(cid:3)(2a (cid:4)a )x(cid:3)(3a (cid:4)a )x2(cid:3)Á (cid:2)0.
1 0 2 1 3 2
Equating the coefficient of each power of xto zero, we have
a (cid:4)a (cid:2)0, 2a (cid:4)a (cid:2)0, 3a (cid:4)a (cid:2)0,Á .
1 0 2 1 3 2

Solving these equations, we may express a , a , in terms of a , which remains arbitrary:

1 0 2 3

With these values of the coefficients, the series solution becomes the familiar general solution
y(cid:2)a (cid:3)a x(cid:3)a 0x2(cid:3)a 0x3(cid:3)Á (cid:2)a 1(cid:3)x(cid:3)x2 (cid:3)x3 (cid:2)a ex.

Test your comprehension by solving
ys(cid:3)y(cid:2)0
by power series. You should get the result
y(cid:2)a cos x(cid:3)a sin x. (cid:2)
0 1
We now describe the method in general and justify it after the next example. For a given
ODE
(4) ys (cid:3)p(x)yr (cid:3)q(x)y(cid:2)0
we first represent p(x) and q(x) by power series in powers of x (or of x(cid:4)x if solutions
0
in powers of x(cid:4)x are wanted). Often p(x) and q(x) are polynomials, and then nothing
0
needs to be done in this first step. Next we assume a solution in the form of a power series
(2) with unknown coefficients and insert it as well as (3) and
(cid:2)
(5) ys (cid:2)2a 2(cid:3)3 # 2a 3 x(cid:3)4 # 3a 4 x2(cid:3) Á (cid:2) a m(m(cid:4)1)a m xm(cid:3)2
m(cid:2)2
into the ODE. Then we collect like powers of xand equate the sum of the coefficients of
each occurring power of xto zero, starting with the constant terms, then taking the terms
containing x, then the terms in x2, and so on. This gives equations from which we can
determine the unknown coefficients of (3) successively.

use (3) and in 2yuse (2). Write like powers of x vertically aligned. This gives

Add terms of like powers of x. For each power x0, x, x2,Á equate the sum obtained to zero. Denote these sums
by [0](constant terms), [1](first power of x), and so on:

a and a remain arbitrary. Hence, this is a general solution that consists of two solutions: x and
10 (cid:4)x2(cid:4)1 1x4(cid:4)1x6(cid:4)Á
. These two solutions are members of families of functions called Legendre polynomials
P(x) and L3 egendr5 e functions Q (x); here we have x(cid:3)P(x) and 1(cid:4)x2(cid:4)1x4(cid:4)1x6(cid:4)Á(cid:3)(cid:4)Q (x). The

Legendre polynomials in the next section.
Theory of the Power Series Method
The nth partial sum of (1) is
(6) s (x)(cid:3)a (cid:2)a (x(cid:4)x )(cid:2)a (x(cid:4)x )2(cid:2) Á (cid:2)a (x(cid:4)x )n

n n(cid:2)1 0 n(cid:2)2 0
This expression is called the remainder of (1) after the term a (x(cid:4)x )n.
n 0
For example, in the case of the geometric series
1(cid:2)x(cid:2)x2(cid:2) Á (cid:2)xn (cid:2) Á
we have
s (cid:3)1, R (cid:3)x(cid:2)x2(cid:2)x3(cid:2) Á ,

SEC. 5.1 Power Series Method 171
In this way we have now associated with (1) the sequence of the partial sums
s (x), s (x), s (x),Á . If for some x(cid:3)x this sequence converges, say,
0 1 2 1
lim s (x )(cid:3)s(x ),
n:(cid:7) n 1 1
then the series (1) is called convergent at x(cid:3)x , the number s(x ) is called the value
1 1
or sum of (1) at x , and we write
1
(cid:2)
s(x 1)(cid:3) a a m(x 1(cid:4)x 0)m.
m(cid:3)0
Then we have for every n,
(8) s(x )(cid:3)s (x )(cid:2)R (x ).
1 n 1 n 1
If that sequence diverges at x(cid:3)x , the series (1) is called divergent at x(cid:3)x .

In the case of convergence, for any positive Pthere is an N (depending on P) such that,

Geometrically, this means that all s (x )with n(cid:6)Nlie between s(x )(cid:4)Pand s(x )(cid:2)P

(Fig. 104). Practically, this means that in the case of convergence we can approximate the
sum s(x ) of (1) at x by s (x ) as accurately as we please, by taking n large enough.

Where does a power series converge? Now if we choose x(cid:3)x in (1), the series reduces
0
to the single term a because the other terms are zero. Hence the series converges at x .
0 0
In some cases this may be the only value of xfor which (1) converges. If there are other
values of xfor which the series converges, these values form an interval, the convergence
interval. This interval may be finite, as in Fig. 105, with midpoint x . Then the series (1)
0
converges for all x in the interior of the interval, that is, for all x for which
(10) ƒx(cid:4)x ƒ (cid:5)R

and diverges for ƒx(cid:4)x ƒ (cid:6)R. The interval may also be infinite, that is, the series may

converge for all x.

The quantity Rin Fig. 105 is called the radius of convergence(because for a complex
power series it is the radius of disk of convergence). If the series converges for all x, we
set R(cid:3) (cid:7) (and 1 R(cid:3)0).

convergence only at the center (R(cid:3)0)is useless. (cid:2)
When do power series solutions exist? Answer: if p, q, r in the ODEs
(12) ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)r(x)
have power series representations (Taylor series). More precisely, a function f(x)is called
analyticat a point x(cid:3)x if it can be represented by a power series in powers of x(cid:4)x
0 0
with positive radius of convergence. Using this concept, we can state the following basic
s
theorem, in which the ODE (12) is in standard form, that is, it begins with the y . If
s
your ODE begins with, say, h(x)y , divide it first by h(x) and then apply the theorem to
the resulting new ODE.
THEOREM 1 Existence of Power Series Solutions
If p, q, and r in (12) are analytic at x(cid:3)x , then every solution of (12) is analytic
0
at x(cid:3)x and can thus be represented by a power series in powers of x(cid:4)x with
0 0
radius of convergence R(cid:6)0.
The proof of this theorem requires advanced complex analysis and can be found in Ref.
[A11] listed in App. 1.
We mention that the radius of convergence Rin Theorem 1 is at least equal to the distance
from the point x(cid:3)x to the point (or points) closest to x at which one of the functions
0 0
p, q, r, as functions of a complex variable, is not analytic. (Note that that point may not
lie on the x-axis but somewhere in the complex plane.)

SEC. 5.1 Power Series Method 173
Further Theory: Operations on Power Series
In the power series method we differentiate, add, and multiply power series, and we obtain
coefficient recursions (as, for instance, in Example 3) by equating the sum of the
coefficients of each occurring power of x to zero. These four operations are permissible
in the sense explained in what follows. Proofs can be found in Sec. 15.3.
1. Termwise Differentiation. A power series may be differentiated term by term. More
precisely: if
(cid:2)
y(x)(cid:3) a a m(x(cid:4)x 0)m
m(cid:3)0
converges for ƒx(cid:4)x ƒ (cid:5)R, where R(cid:6)0, then the series obtained by differentiating term

r
by term also converges for those x and represents the derivative y of y for those x:
(cid:2)
yr (x)(cid:3) a ma m(x(cid:4)x 0)m(cid:3)1 (ƒx(cid:4)x 0ƒ (cid:5)R).
m(cid:3)1
Similarly for the second and further derivatives.
2. Termwise Addition. Two power series may be added term by term. More precisely:
if the series
(cid:2) (cid:2)
(13) a a m(x(cid:4)x 0)m and a b m(x(cid:4)x 0)m
m(cid:3)0 m(cid:3)0
have positive radii of convergence and their sums are f(x) and g(x), then the series
(cid:2)
a (a m(cid:2)b m)(x(cid:4)x 0)m
m(cid:3)0
converges and represents f(x)(cid:2)g(x)for each xthat lies in the interior of the convergence
interval common to each of the two given series.
3. Termwise Multiplication. Two power series may be multiplied term by term.More
precisely: Suppose that the series (13) have positive radii of convergence and let f(x)and
g(x) be their sums. Then the series obtained by multiplying each term of the first series
by each term of the second series and collecting like powers of x(cid:4)x , that is,

Legendre’s differential equation1
(1) (1 (cid:4)x2)ys (cid:4)2xyr (cid:2)n(n(cid:2)1)y(cid:3)0 (n constant)
is one of the most important ODEs in physics. It arises in numerous problems, particularly
in boundary value problems for spheres (take a quick look at Example 1 in Sec. 12.10).
The equation involves a parameter n, whose value depends on the physical or
engineering problem. So (1) is actually a whole family of ODEs. For n(cid:3)1 we solved it
in Example 3 of Sec. 5.1 (look back at it). Any solution of (1) is called a Legendre function.
The study of these and other “higher” functions not occurring in calculus is called the
theory of special functions. Further special functions will occur in the next sections.
Dividing (1) by 1(cid:4)x2, we obtain the standard form needed in Theorem 1 of Sec. 5.1
and we see that the coefficients (cid:4)2x (1 (cid:4)x2)and n(n(cid:2)1) (1 (cid:4)x2)of the new equation

are analytic at x(cid:3)0, so that we may apply the power series method. Substituting

m(cid:3)2 m(cid:3)2 m(cid:3)1 m(cid:3)0
It may help you to write out the first few terms of each series explicitly, as in Example 3
of Sec. 5.1; or you may continue as follows. To obtain the same general power xs in all
four series, set m(cid:4)2(cid:3)s (thus m(cid:3)s(cid:2)2) in the first series and simply write s instead
of m in the other three series. This gives

(Note that in the first series the summation begins with s(cid:3)0.) Since this equation with
the right side 0 must be an identity in x if (2) is to be a solution of (1), the sum of the
coefficients of each power of x on the left must be zero. Now x0 occurs in the first and
fourth series only, and gives [remember that k(cid:3)n(n(cid:2)1)]

The expression in the brackets [Á ] can be written (n(cid:4)s)(n (cid:2)s(cid:2)1), as you may

Note that x (cid:3)(cid:9)1 are the points at which 1(cid:4)x2(cid:3)0, so that the coefficients of the
standardized ODE are no longer analytic. So it should not surprise you that we do not get
a longer convergence interval of (6) and (7), unless these series terminate after finitely
many powers. In that case, the series become polynomials.

n
The reduction of power series to polynomials is a great advantage because then we have
solutions for all x, without convergence restrictions. For special functions arising as
solutions of ODEs this happens quite frequently, leading to various important families of
polynomials; see Refs. [GenRef1], [GenRef10] in App. 1. For Legendre’s equation this
happens when the parameter nis a nonnegative integer because then the right side of (4)
is zero for s(cid:3)n, so that a (cid:3)0, a (cid:3)0, a (cid:3)0,Á . Hence if n is even, y (x)
n(cid:2)2 n(cid:2)4 n(cid:2)6 1
reduces to a polynomial of degree n. If n is odd, the same is true for y (x). These
2
polynomials, multiplied by some constants, are called Legendre polynomials and are
denoted by P (x). The standard choice of such constants is done as follows. We choose
n
the coefficient a of the highest power xn as

(8) a (cid:3) (cid:3) (n a positive integer)

The choice (8) makes p (1) (cid:3)1 for every n (see Fig. 107); this motivates (8). From (9)

Extended Power Series Method:
Frobenius Method
Several second-order ODEs of considerable practical importance—the famous Bessel
equation among them—have coefficients that are not analytic (definition in Sec. 5.1), but
are “not too bad,” so that these ODEs can still be solved by series (power series times a
logarithm or times a fractional power of x, etc.). Indeed, the following theorem permits
an extension of the power series method. The new method is called the Frobenius
method.4Both methods, that is, the power series method and the Frobenius method, have
gained in significance due to the use of software in actual calculations.
THEOREM 1 Frobenius Method
Let b(x) and c(x) be any functions that are analytic at x(cid:2)0. Then the ODE
b(x) c(x)
(1) ys (cid:3) yr (cid:3) y(cid:2)0
x x2
has at least one solution that can be represented in the form
(cid:2)
(2) y(x) (cid:2)xr a a m xm(cid:2)xr(a 0(cid:3)a 1x(cid:3)a 2 x2(cid:3) Á ) (a 0(cid:6)0)
m(cid:2)0
where the exponent r may be any (real or complex)number (and r is chosen so that
a (cid:6)0).
0
The ODE (1)also has a second solution (such that these two solutions are linearly
independent)that may be similar to (2)(with a different r and different coefficients)
or may contain a logarithmic term. (Details in Theorem 2 below.)

4GEORG FROBENIUS (1849–1917), German mathematician, professor at ETH Zurich and University of Berlin,
student of Karl Weierstrass (see footnote, Sect. 15.5). He is also known for his work on matrices and in group theory.
In this theorem we may replace xby x(cid:4)x with any number x . The condition a (cid:6)0 is no restriction; it
0 0 0
simply means that we factor out the highest possible power of x.
The singular point of (1) at x(cid:2)0 is often called a regular singular point, a term confusing to the student,
which we shall not use.

SEC. 5.3 Extended Power Series Method: Frobenius Method 181
For example, Bessel’s equation (to be discussed in the next section)
ys (cid:2) 1 yr (cid:2) x2(cid:4)v2 y(cid:3)0 (v a parameter)
x a x2 b
is of the form (1) with b(x)(cid:3)1and c(x) (cid:3)x2(cid:4)v2analytic at x(cid:3)0, so that the theorem
applies. This ODE could not be handled in full generality by the power series method.
Similarly, the so-called hypergeometric differential equation (see Problem Set 5.3) also
requires the Frobenius method.
The point is that in (2) we have a power series times a single power of xwhose exponent
ris not restricted to be a nonnegative integer. (The latter restriction would make the whole
expression a power series, by definition; see Sec. 5.1.)
The proof of the theorem requires advanced methods of complex analysis and can be
found in Ref. [A11] listed in App. 1.
Regular and Singular Points. The following terms are practical and commonly used.
A regular point of the ODE
ys (cid:2)p(x)yr (cid:2)q(x)y(cid:3)0
is a point x at which the coefficients pand qare analytic. Similarly, a regular pointof
0
the ODE
h~ (x)ys (cid:2)p~ (x)yr (x) (cid:2)q~ (x)y(cid:3)0
is an x at which h~ , p~ , q~ are analytic and h~ (x )(cid:11)0(so what we can divide by h~ and get
0 0
the previous standard form). Then the power series method can be applied. If x is not a
0
regular point, it is called a singular point.
Indicial Equation, Indicating the Form of Solutions
We shall now explain the Frobenius method for solving (1). Multiplication of (1) by x2
gives the more convenient form
(1r
)
x2ys(cid:2)xb(x)yr(cid:2)c(x)y(cid:3)0.
We first expand b(x) and c(x) in power series,
b(x)(cid:3)b (cid:2)b x(cid:2)b x2(cid:2) Á , c(x)(cid:3)c (cid:2)c x(cid:2)c x2(cid:2) Á

or we do nothing if b(x)and c(x)are polynomials. Then we differentiate (2) term by term,
finding

By inserting all these series into (1 ) we obtain

We now equate the sum of the coefficients of each power xr, xr(cid:2)1, xr(cid:2)2,Á to zero. This
yields a system of equations involving the unknown coefficients a . The smallest power
m
is xr and the corresponding equation is
[r(r (cid:4)1)(cid:2)b r(cid:2)c ]a (cid:3)0.
0 0 0
Since by assumption a (cid:11)0, the expression in the brackets [Á ] must be zero. This
0
gives
(4) r(r (cid:4)1)(cid:2)b r(cid:2)c (cid:3)0.
0 0
This important quadratic equation is called the indicial equationof the ODE (1). Its role
is as follows.
The Frobenius method yields a basis of solutions. One of the two solutions will always
be of the form (2), where ris a root of (4). The other solution will be of a form indicated
by the indicial equation. There are three cases:
Á
Case 1. Distinct roots not differing by an integer 1, 2, 3, .
Case 2. A double root.
Á
Case 3. Roots differing by an integer 1, 2, 3, .
Cases 1 and 2 are not unexpected because of the Euler–Cauchy equation (Sec. 2.5), the
simplest ODE of the form (1). Case 1 includes complex conjugate roots r and r (cid:3)r
1 2 1
because r (cid:4)r (cid:3)r (cid:4)r (cid:3)2i Im r is imaginary, so it cannot be a real integer. The
1 2 1 1 1
form of a basis will be given in Theorem 2 (which is proved in App. 4), without a general
theory of convergence, but convergence of the occurring series can be tested in each
individual case as usual. Note that in Case 2 we musthave a logarithm, whereas in Case 3
we may or may not.
THEOREM 2 Frobenius Method. Basis of Solutions. Three Cases
Suppose that the ODE (1)satisfies the assumptions in Theorem 1. Let r and r be
1 2
the roots of the indicial equation (4). Then we have the following three cases.
Case 1. Distinct Roots Not Differing by an Integer. A basis is
(5) y 1(x) (cid:3)xr1(a 0(cid:2)a 1x(cid:2)a
2
x2(cid:2) Á )
and
(6) y 2(x)(cid:3)xr2(A 0(cid:2)A 1x(cid:2)A
2
x2(cid:2) Á )
with coefficients obtained successively from (3)with r(cid:3)r and r(cid:3)r , respectively.

Case 2. Double Root r (cid:4)r (cid:4)r. A basis is
1 2
(7) y (x)(cid:3)xr(a (cid:2)a x(cid:2)a x2(cid:2) Á ) [r (cid:3)1(1 (cid:4)b )]

(of the same general form as before) and
(8) y (x)(cid:3)y (x) ln x(cid:2)xr(A x(cid:2)A x2(cid:2) Á ) (x(cid:6)0).
2 1 1 2
Case 3. Roots Differing by an Integer. A basis is
(9) y 1(x)(cid:3)xr1(a 0(cid:2)a 1x(cid:2)a
2
x2(cid:2) Á )
(of the same general form as before) and
(10) y 2(x)(cid:3)ky 1(x) ln x(cid:2)xr2(A 0(cid:2)A 1x(cid:2)A
2
x2(cid:2) Á ),
where the roots are so denoted that r (cid:4)r (cid:6)0 and k may turn out to be zero.

Typical Applications
Technically, the Frobenius method is similar to the power series method, once the roots
of the indicial equation have been determined. However, (5)–(10) merely indicate the
general form of a basis, and a second solution can often be obtained more rapidly by
reduction of order (Sec. 2.1).

substitution of y(cid:3)xrgives the auxiliary equation
r(r(cid:4)1)(cid:2)br(cid:2)c (cid:3)0,
0 0
which is the indicial equation [and y(cid:3)xris a very special form of (2)!]. For different roots r , r we get a basis
1 2
y 1(cid:3)xr1, y 2(cid:3)xr2, and for a double root rwe get a basis xr, xr ln x. Accordingly, for this simple ODE, Case
(cid:2)

plays no extra role.

Solution. Writing (11) in the standard form (1), we see that it satisfies the assumptions in Theorem 1. [What

184 CHAP. 5 Series Solutions of ODEs. Special Functions
The smallest power is xr(cid:3)1, occurring in the second and the fourth series; by equating the sum of its coefficients
to zero we have
[(cid:4)r(r(cid:4)1)(cid:4)r]a (cid:3)0, thus r2(cid:3)0.
0
Hence this indicial equation has the double root r(cid:3)0.
First Solution. We insert this value r(cid:3)0into (12) and equate the sum of the coefficients of the power
xsto zero, obtaining
s(s(cid:4)1)a s(cid:4)(s(cid:2)1)sa s(cid:2)1(cid:2)3sa s(cid:4)(s(cid:2)1)a s(cid:2)1(cid:2)a s(cid:3)0
thus a s(cid:2)1(cid:3)a s. Hence a 0(cid:3)a 1(cid:3)a 2(cid:3) Á , and by choosing a 0(cid:3)1we obtain the solution

m(cid:3)0
Second Solution. We get a second independent solution y by the method of reduction of order (Sec. 2.1),
2
substituting y (cid:3)uy and its derivatives into the equation. This leads to (9), Sec. 2.1, which we shall use in
2 1
thisexample, instead of starting reduction of order from scratch (as we shall do in the next example). In (9) of
Sec. 2.1 we have p(cid:3)(3x(cid:4)1) (x2(cid:4)x), the coefficient of yr in (11) in standard form. By partial fractions,

Hence (9), Sec. 2.1, becomes

The lowest power is xr(cid:3)1(take s(cid:3)(cid:4)1in the second series) and gives the indicial equation
r(r(cid:4)1)(cid:3)0.
The roots are r (cid:3)1and r (cid:3)0. They differ by an integer. This is Case 3.

From this, using partial fractions and integrating (taking the integration constant zero), we get

The Frobenius method solves the hypergeometric equation, whose solutions include

5CARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS (1777–1855), great German mathematician. He already made the first of his great
discoveries as a student at Helmstedt and Göttingen. In 1807 he became a professor and director of the Observatory
at Göttingen. His work was of basic importance in algebra, number theory, differential equations, differential
geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, complex analysis, numeric analysis, astronomy, geodesy, electromagnetism,
and theoretical mechanics. He also paved the way for a general and systematic use of complex numbers.

Bessel’s Equation. Bessel Functions J (x)
(cid:12)
One of the most important ODEs in applied mathematics in Bessel’s equation,6
(1) x2ys (cid:2)xyr (cid:2)(x2(cid:4)(cid:12)2)y(cid:3)0
where the parameter (cid:12) (nu) is a given real number which is positive or zero. Bessel’s
equation often appears if a problem shows cylindrical symmetry, for example, as the
membranes in Sec.12.9. The equation satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 1. To see this,
divide (1) by x2to get the standard form ys (cid:2)yr x(cid:2)(1 (cid:4)(cid:12)2 x2)y(cid:3)0. Hence, according

to the Frobenius theory, it has a solution of the form
(cid:2)
(2) y(x) (cid:3) a a m xm(cid:2)r (a 0 (cid:11)0).
m(cid:3)0
Substituting (2) and its first and second derivatives into Bessel’s equation, we obtain

m(cid:3)0 m(cid:3)0
We equate the sum of the coefficients of
xs(cid:2)r
to zero. Note that this power
xs(cid:2)r
corresponds to m(cid:3)sin the first, second, and fourth series, and to m(cid:3)s(cid:4)2in the third
series. Hence for s(cid:3)0 and s(cid:3)1, the third series does not contribute since m(cid:10)0.

on his own in his spare time as an apprentice of a trade company and finally became director of the new Königsberg
Observatory.
Formulas on Bessel functions are contained in Ref. [GenRef10] and the standard treatise [A13].

a is still arbitrary, so that the series (2) with these coefficients would contain this arbitrary

factor a . This would be a highly impractical situation for developing formulas or

computing values of this new function. Accordingly, we have to make a choice. The choice
a (cid:3)1 would be possible. A simpler series (2) could be obtained if we could absorb the

J (x)is called the Bessel function of the first kindof order n.The series (11) converges

for all x, as the ratio test shows. Hence J (x) is defined for all x. The series converges

very rapidly because of the factorials in the denominator.

Hence the gamma function generalizes the factorial function to arbitrary positive (cid:12).

Discovery of Properties from Series
Bessel functions are a model case for showing how to discover properties and relations of
functions from series by which they are defined.Bessel functions satisfy an incredibly large
number of relationships—look at Ref. [A13] in App. 1; also, find out what your CAS knows.
In Theorem 3 we shall discuss four formulas that are backbones in applications and theory.
THEOREM 1 Derivatives, Recursions

PROOF (a) We multiply (20) by
x(cid:12)
and take
x2(cid:12)
under the summation sign. Then we have
(cid:2) ((cid:4)1)mx2m(cid:2)2(cid:12)
x(cid:12) J (cid:12)(x) (cid:3) a
22m(cid:2)(cid:12) m! (cid:13)((cid:12)(cid:2)m (cid:2)1)
.
m(cid:3)0
We now differentiate this, cancel a factor 2, pull
x2(cid:12)(cid:3)1
out, and use the functional
relationship (cid:13)((cid:12)(cid:2)m (cid:2)1)(cid:3)((cid:12)(cid:2)m)(cid:13)((cid:12)(cid:2)m) [see (17)]. Then (20) with (cid:12)(cid:4)1 instead
of (cid:12) shows that we obtain the right side of (21a). Indeed,
(cid:2) ((cid:4)1)m2(m(cid:2)(cid:12))x2m(cid:2)2(cid:12)(cid:3)1 (cid:2) ((cid:4)1)mx2m

22m(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:3)1m! (cid:13)((cid:12)(cid:2)m)
.
m(cid:3)0 m(cid:3)0
(cid:3)(cid:12) (cid:12)
(b)Similarly, we multiply (20) by x , so that x in (20) cancels. Then we differentiate,
cancel 2m, and use m!(cid:3)m(m(cid:4)1)!. This gives, with m(cid:3)s(cid:2)1,
(cid:2) ((cid:4)1)mx2m(cid:3)1 (cid:2) ((cid:4)1)s(cid:2)1x2s(cid:2)1
(x(cid:3)(cid:12) J (cid:12))r (cid:3) a

22s(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:2)1s! (cid:13)((cid:12)(cid:2)s (cid:2)2)
.
m(cid:3)1 s(cid:3)0
Equation (20) with (cid:12)(cid:2)1 instead of (cid:12) and s instead of m shows that the expression on
the right is
(cid:4)x(cid:3)(cid:12)
J (x). This proves (21b).
(cid:12)(cid:2)1
(c), (d) We perform the differentiation in (21a). Then we do the same in (21b) and
multiply the result on both sides by
x2(cid:12)
. This gives
(a*)
(cid:12)x(cid:12)(cid:3)1J (cid:2)x(cid:12) Jr (cid:3)x(cid:12)
J
(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:3)1

J .
(cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:2)1
(cid:12)
Substracting (b*) from (a*) and dividing the result by x gives (21c). Adding (a*) and
(b*) and dividing the result by x(cid:12) gives (21d). (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 2 Application of Theorem 1 in Evaluation and Integration
Formula (21c) can be used recursively in the form

J(cid:12)(cid:2)1(x)(cid:3)
x
J(cid:12)(x)(cid:4)J(cid:12)(cid:3)1(x)
for calculating Bessel functions of higher order from those of lower order. For instance, J (x)(cid:3)2J (x) x(cid:4)J (x),
2 1 > 0
so that J can be obtained from tables of J and J (in App. 5 or, more accurately, in Ref. [GenRef1] in App. 1).
2 0 1
To illustrate how Theorem 1 helps in integration, we use (21b) with (cid:12)(cid:3)3 integrated on both sides. This
evaluates, for instance, the integral

General Solution. Linear Dependence
For a general solution of Bessel’s equation (1) in addition to J we need a second linearly
(cid:12)
independent solution. For (cid:12) not an integer this is easy. Replacing (cid:12) by (cid:4)(cid:12) in (20), we
have
(cid:2) ((cid:4)1)mx2m
(24) J (cid:3)(cid:12)(x)
(cid:3)x(cid:3)(cid:12)
a .
22m(cid:3)(cid:12) m! (cid:13)(m(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:2)1)
m(cid:3)0
Since Bessel’s equation involves (cid:12)2, the functions J and J are solutions of the equation
(cid:12) (cid:3)(cid:12)
for the same (cid:12). If (cid:12)is not an integer, they are linearly independent, because the first terms
in (20) and in (24) are finite nonzero multiples of x(cid:12) and x(cid:3)(cid:12) . Thus, if (cid:12)is not an integer,
a general solution of Bessel’s equation for all x(cid:11)0 is
y(x)(cid:3)c J (x) (cid:2)c J (x)
1 (cid:12) 2 (cid:3)(cid:12)
This cannot be the general solution for an integer (cid:12)(cid:3)n because, in that case, we have
linear dependence. It can be seen that the first terms in (20) and (24) are finite nonzero
multiples of x(cid:12) and x(cid:3)(cid:12) , respectively. This means that, for any integer (cid:12)(cid:3)n, we have
linear dependence because
(25) J (x)(cid:3)((cid:4)1)n J (x) (n(cid:3)1, 2,Á ).

(cid:12)
PROOF To prove (25), we use (24) and let (cid:12) approach a positive integer n. Then the gamma
function in the coefficients of the first n terms becomes infinite (see Fig. 553 in App.
A3.1), the coefficients become zero, and the summation starts with m(cid:3) n. Since in
this case (cid:13)(m(cid:4)n(cid:2)1)(cid:3)(m(cid:4)n)! by (18), we obtain
(cid:2) ((cid:4)1) mx2m(cid:3)n (cid:2) ((cid:4)1)n(cid:2)sx2s(cid:2)n

(m(cid:3)n(cid:2)s).
m(cid:3)n s(cid:3)0
The last series represents ((cid:4)1)nJ (x), as you can see from (11) with mreplaced by s. This
n
completes the proof. (cid:2)
The difficulty caused by (25) will be overcome in the next section by introducing further
Bessel functions, called of the second kind and denoted by Y.

Bessel Functions Y (x). General Solution
n
To obtain a general solution of Bessel’s equation (1), Sec. 5.4, for any (cid:12), we now introduce
Bessel functions of the second kind Y(x),beginning with the case (cid:12)(cid:3)n (cid:3)0.
(cid:12)
When n(cid:3)0, Bessel’s equation can be written (divide by x)
(1) xys (cid:2)yr (cid:2)xy(cid:3)0.
Then the indicial equation (4) in Sec. 5.4 has a double root r(cid:3)0. This is Case 2 in Sec.
5.3. In this case we first have only one solution, J (x). From (8) in Sec. 5.3 we see that
0
the desired second solution must be of the form

m(cid:3)1 m(cid:3)1 m(cid:3)1
First, we show that the A with odd subscripts are all zero. The power x0occurs only in
m
the second series, with coefficient A . Hence A (cid:3)0. Next, we consider the even powers
1 1
x2s. The first series contains none. In the second series, m(cid:4)1(cid:3)2s gives the term
(2s (cid:2)1)2A x2s. In the third series, m(cid:2)1(cid:3)2s. Hence by equating the sum of the
2s(cid:2)1
coefficients of x2s to zero we have
(2s (cid:2)1)2A (cid:2)A (cid:3)0, s (cid:3)1, 2,Á .
2s(cid:2)1 2s(cid:3)1
Since A (cid:3)0, we thus obtain A (cid:3)0, A (cid:3)0,Á , successively.
1 3 5
We now equate the sum of the coefficients of x2s(cid:2)1 to zero. For s(cid:3)0 this gives
(cid:4)1(cid:2)4A (cid:3)0, thus A (cid:3)1.
2 2 4
For the other values of s we have in the first series in (3*) 2m (cid:4)1(cid:3)2s(cid:2)1, hence
m(cid:3)s(cid:2)1, in the second m(cid:4)1(cid:3)2s(cid:2)1, and in the third m(cid:2)1(cid:3)2s(cid:2)1.We thus obtain

(cid:2)(2s (cid:2)2)2A (cid:2)A (cid:3)0.
22s(s (cid:2)1)! s! 2s(cid:2)2 2s

Bessel Functions of the Second Kind Y (x)
n
For (cid:2)(cid:4)n (cid:4)1, 2,Á a second solution can be obtained by manipulations similar to those
for n(cid:4)0, starting from (10), Sec. 5.4. It turns out that in these cases the solution also
contains a logarithmic term.
The situation is not yet completely satisfactory, because the second solution is defined
differently, depending on whether the order (cid:2)is an integer or not. To provide uniformity
of formalism, it is desirable to adopt a form of the second solution that is valid for all
values of the order. For this reason we introduce a standard second solution Y(x)defined
(cid:2)
for all (cid:2) by the formula

This function is called the Bessel function of the second kindof order(cid:2)or Neumann’s

Let us show that J and Y are indeed linearly independent for all (cid:2) (and x(cid:3) 0).
(cid:2) (cid:2)
For noninteger order (cid:2), the function Y(x)is evidently a solution of Bessel’s equation
(cid:2)
because J (x) and J (x) are solutions of that equation. Since for those (cid:2) the solutions
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
J and J are linearly independent and Y involves J , the functions J and Y are

Such a solution is obtained by substituting (2) and its derivatives into (1). This gives
a recurrence formulafor the coefficients. You may program this formula (or even
obtain and graph the whole solution) on your CAS.
If p and q are analytic at x (that is, representable by a power series in powers
0
of x – x with positive radius of convergence; Sec. 5.1), then (1) has solutions of
0 (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)

Laplace Transforms
Laplace transforms are invaluable for any engineer’s mathematical toolbox as they make
solving linear ODEs and related initial value problems, as well as systems of linear ODEs,
much easier. Applications abound: electrical networks, springs, mixing problems, signal
processing, and other areas of engineering and physics.
The process of solving an ODE using the Laplace transform method consists of three
steps, shown schematically in Fig. 113:
Step 1. The given ODE is transformed into an algebraic equation, called the subsidiary
equation.
Step 2. The subsidiary equation is solved by purely algebraic manipulations.
Step 3. The solution in Step 2 is transformed back, resulting in the solution of the given
problem.

Problem 1 Problem 2 by Algebra 3 IVP
Fig. 113. Solving an IVP by Laplace transforms
The key motivation for learning about Laplace transforms is that the process of solving
an ODE is simplified to an algebraic problem (and transformations). This type of
mathematics that converts problems of calculus to algebraic problems is known as
operational calculus. The Laplace transform method has two main advantages over the
methods discussed in Chaps. 1–4:
I. Problems are solved more directly: Initial value problems are solved without first
determining a general solution. Nonhomogenous ODEs are solved without first solving
the corresponding homogeneous ODE.
II. More importantly, the use of the unit step function(Heaviside functionin Sec.6.3)
and Dirac’s delta(in Sec. 6.4) make the method particularly powerful for problems with
inputs (driving forces) that have discontinuities or represent short impulses or complicated
periodic functions.

Laplace Transform. Linearity.
First Shifting Theorem (s-Shifting)
In this section, we learn about Laplace transforms and some of their properties. Because
Laplace transforms are of basic importance to the engineer, the student should pay close
attention to the material. Applications to ODEs follow in the next section.
Roughly speaking, the Laplace transform, when applied to a function, changes that
function into a new function by using a process that involves integration. Details are as
follows.
If f(t)is a function defined for all t(cid:4)0, its Laplace transform1is the integral of f(t)
times e(cid:3)st from t(cid:2)0 to (cid:3). It is a function of s, say, F(s), and is denoted by l(f); thus
(cid:2)(cid:2)
(1) F(s)(cid:2)l(f)(cid:2) e(cid:3)stf(t) dt.
˛
0
Here we must assume that f(t) is such that the integral exists (that is, has some finite
value). This assumption is usually satisfied in applications—we shall discuss this near the
end of the section.
1PIERRE SIMON MARQUIS DE LAPLACE (1749–1827), great French mathematician, was a professor in
Paris. He developed the foundation of potential theory and made important contributions to celestial mechanics,
astronomy in general, special functions, and probability theory. Napoléon Bonaparte was his student for a year.
For Laplace’s interesting political involvements, see Ref. [GenRef2], listed in App. 1.
The powerful practical Laplace transform techniques were developed over a century later by the English
electrical engineer OLIVER HEAVISIDE (1850–1925) and were often called “Heaviside calculus.”
We shall drop variables when this simplifies formulas without causing confusion. For instance, in (1) we
wrote l( f )instead of l(f)(s)and in (1*) l(cid:3)1(F)instead of l(cid:3)1(F)(t).

SEC. 6.1 Laplace Transform. Linearity. First Shifting Theorem (s-Shifting) 205
Not only is the result F(s)called the Laplace transform, but the operation just described,
which yields F(s)from a given f(t), is also called the Laplace transform. It is an “integral
transform”
(cid:2)(cid:2)
F(s)(cid:2) k(s, t)f(t) dt
0
with “kernel” k(s,
t)(cid:2)e(cid:3)st.
Note that the Laplace transform is called an integral transform because it transforms
(changes) a function in one space to a function in another space by a process of integration
that involves a kernel. The kernel or kernel function is a function of the variables in the
two spaces and defines the integral transform.
Furthermore, the given function f(t)in (1) is called the inverse transformof F(s)and
is denoted by
l(cid:3)1(F);
that is, we shall write
˛
(1*)
f(t)(cid:2)l(cid:3)1(F).
Note that (1) and (1*) together imply l(cid:5)1(l( f ))(cid:2)f and l(l(cid:5)1(F)) (cid:2)F.
Notation
Original functions depend on t and their transforms on s—keep this in mind! Original
functions are denoted by lowercase lettersand their transforms by the same letters in capital,
so that F(s)denotes the transform of f(t), and Y(s)denotes the transform of y(t), and so on.

206 CHAP. 6 Laplace Transforms
Must we go on in this fashion and obtain the transform of one function after another
directly from the definition? No! We can obtain new transforms from known ones by the
use of the many general properties of the Laplace transform. Above all, the Laplace
transform is a “linear operation,” just as are differentiation and integration. By this we
mean the following.
THEOREM 1 Linearity of the Laplace Transform
The Laplace transform is a linear operation; that is, for any functionsf(t)and g(t)
whose transforms exist and any constants a and b the transform of af(t)(cid:7)bg(t)
exists, and
l{af(t)(cid:7)bg(t)} (cid:2)al{f(t)} (cid:7)bl{g(t)}.
PROOF This is true because integration is a linear operation so that (1) gives

Basic transformsare listed in Table 6.1. We shall see that from these almost all the others
can be obtained by the use of the general properties of the Laplace transform. Formulas
1–3 are special cases of formula 4, which is proved by induction. Indeed, it is true for
n(cid:3)0because of Example 1 and 0!(cid:3)1. We make the induction hypothesis that it holds
for any integer n(cid:6)0 and then get it for n(cid:2)1 directly from (1). Indeed, integration by

s-Shifting: Replacing s by s a in the Transform
The Laplace transform has the very useful property that, if we know the transform of f(t),
we can immediately get that of eatf(t), as follows.
THEOREM 2 First Shifting Theorem, s-Shifting
Iff(t)has the transform F(s)(where s(cid:6)kfor some k), then eatf(t)has the transform
F(s (cid:5)a) (where s(cid:5)a(cid:6)k). In formulas,
l{eatf(t)} (cid:2)F(s(cid:5)a)
or, if we take the inverse on both sides,
eatf(t)(cid:2)l(cid:3)1{F(s(cid:5)a)}.
PROOF We obtain F(s(cid:5)a) by replacing s with s(cid:5)a in the integral in (1), so that
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
F(s (cid:5)a)(cid:2) e(cid:3)(s(cid:3)a)tf(t) dt(cid:2) e(cid:3)st eatf(t) dt(cid:2)l{eatf(t)}.

0 0
If F(s) exists (i.e., is finite) for s greater than some k, then our first integral exists for
s(cid:5)a(cid:6)k. Now take the inverse on both sides of this formula to obtain the second formula
in the theorem. (CAUTION! (cid:5)a in F(s(cid:5)a) but (cid:7)a in eatf(t).) (cid:2)

Existence and Uniqueness of Laplace Transforms
This is not a big practical problem because in most cases we can check the solution of
an ODE without too much trouble. Nevertheless we should be aware of some basic facts.
A function f(t)has a Laplace transform if it does not grow too fast, say, if for all t(cid:4)0
and some constants M and k it satisfies the “growth restriction”
(2) ƒf(t)ƒ (cid:10)Mekt.
(The growth restriction (2) is sometimes called “growth of exponential order,” which may
be misleading since it hides that the exponent must be kt, not kt2 or similar.)
f(t)need not be continuous, but it should not be too bad. The technical term (generally
used in mathematics) is piecewise continuity. f(t) is piecewise continuous on a finite
interval a(cid:10)t(cid:10)b where f is defined, if this interval can be divided into finitely many
subintervals in each of which fis continuous and has finite limits as tapproaches either
endpoint of such a subinterval from the interior. This then gives finite jumps as in
Fig. 115 as the only possible discontinuities, but this suffices in most applications, and
so does the following theorem.

THEOREM 3 Existence Theorem for Laplace Transforms
If f(t) is defined and piecewise continuous on every finite interval on the semi-axis
t(cid:4)0 and satisfies (2) for all t(cid:4)0 and some constants M and k, then the Laplace
transform l( f ) exists for all s(cid:6)k.
PROOF Since f(t) is piecewise continuous,
e(cid:3)stf(t)
is integrable over any finite interval on the
t-axis. From (2), assuming that s(cid:6)k (to be needed for the existence of the last of the
following integrals), we obtain the proof of the existence of l( f ) from
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)

` ` s(cid:5)k
0 0 0
Note that (2) can be readily checked. For instance, cosh t (cid:11)et, tn(cid:11)n!et(because tn n!
>
is a single term of the Maclaurin series), and so on. A function that does not satisfy (2)
for any M and k is et2 (take logarithms to see it). We mention that the conditions in
Theorem 3 are sufficient rather than necessary (see Prob. 22).
Uniqueness. If the Laplace transform of a given function exists, it is uniquely
determined. Conversely, it can be shown that if two functions (both defined on the positive
real axis) have the same transform, these functions cannot differ over an interval of positive
length, although they may differ at isolated points (see Ref. [A14] in App. 1). Hence we
may say that the inverse of a given transform is essentially unique. In particular, if two
continuous functions have the same transform, they are completely identical.

Transforms of Derivatives and Integrals.
ODEs
The Laplace transform is a method of solving ODEs and initial value problems. The crucial
idea is that operations of calculus on functions are replaced by operations of algebra
on transforms. Roughly, differentiationof f(t)will correspond to multiplicationof l( f )
by s (see Theorems 1 and 2) and integration of f(t) to division of l( f ) by s. To solve
ODEs, we must first consider the Laplace transform of derivatives. You have encountered
such an idea in your study of logarithms. Under the application of the natural logarithm,
a product of numbers becomes a sum of their logarithms, a division of numbers becomes
their difference of logarithms (see Appendix 3, formulas (2), (3)). To simplify calculations
was one of the main reasons that logarithms were invented in pre-computer times.
THEOREM 1 Laplace Transform of Derivatives
The transforms of the first and second derivatives of f(t) satisfy
(1) l( fr )(cid:2)sl( f )(cid:5)f(0)
(2) l( fs )(cid:2)s2l( f )(cid:5)sf(0) (cid:5)fr (0).
Formula (1) holds if f(t) is continuous for all t(cid:4)0 and satisfies the growth
r
restriction (2) in Sec. 6.1 and f (t) is piecewise continuous on every finite interval
on the semi-axis t(cid:4)0. Similarly, (2) holds if f and fr are continuous for all t(cid:4)0
s
and satisfy the growth restriction and f is piecewise continuous on every finite
interval on the semi-axis t(cid:4)0.
c06.qxd 10/28/10 6:33 PM Page 212

PROOF We prove (1) first under the additional assumption that f is continuous. Then, by the
definition and integration by parts,

4`(cid:2) (cid:7)s(cid:2)(cid:2)
e(cid:3)stf (t) dt.
0 0 0
Since f satisfies (2) in Sec. 6.1, the integrated part on the right is zero at the upper limit
when s(cid:6)k,and at the lower limit it contributes (cid:5)f(0).The last integral is l( f ).It exists
for s(cid:6)kbecause of Theorem 3 in Sec. 6.1. Hence l( fr )exists when s(cid:6)kand (1) holds.
r
If f is merely piecewise continuous, the proof is similar. In this case the interval of
r r
integration of f must be broken up into parts such that f is continuous in each such part.
s
The proof of (2) now follows by applying (1) to f and then substituting (1), that is
l( fs )(cid:2)sl( fr )(cid:5)fr (0) (cid:2)s sl( f )(cid:5)f(0) (cid:2)s2l( f )(cid:5)sf(0) (cid:5)fr (0). (cid:2)
3 4
Continuing by substitution as in the proof of (2) and using induction, we obtain the
following extension of Theorem 1.
THEOREM 2 Laplace Transform of the Derivative f(n)of Any Order
Let f, fr ,Á , f(n(cid:3)1) be continuous for all t(cid:4)0 and satisfy the growth restriction
(2)in Sec.6.1. Furthermore, letf(n)be piecewise continuous on every finite interval
on the semi-axis t(cid:4)0. Then the transform of f(n) satisfies
(3) l( f(n))(cid:2)snl( f )(cid:5)sn(cid:3)1f(0) (cid:5)sn(cid:3)2fr (0) (cid:5) Á(cid:5) f(n(cid:3)1)(0).
EXAMPLE 1 Transform of a Resonance Term (Sec. 2.8)
Let f(t)(cid:2)t sin vt.Then f(0)(cid:2)0, fr (t)(cid:2)sin vt(cid:7)vt cos vt, fr (0)(cid:2)0, fs(cid:2)2v cos vt(cid:5)v2t sin vt.Hence
by (2),
l( fs )(cid:2)2v s (cid:5)v2l( f )(cid:2)s2l( f ), thus l( f )(cid:2)l(t sin vt)(cid:2) 2vs . (cid:2)

EXAMPLE 2 Formulas 7 and 8 in Table 6.1, Sec. 6.1
This is a third derivation of l(cos vt) and l(sin vt); cf. Example 4 in Sec. 6.1. Let f(t)(cid:2)cos vt. Then
f(0)(cid:2)1, fr (0)(cid:2)0, fs (t)(cid:2)(cid:5)v2 cos vt.From this and (2) we obtain
l( fs )(cid:2)s2l( f )(cid:5)s(cid:2)(cid:5)v2l( f ). By algebra, l(cos vt)(cid:2) s .
s2(cid:7)v2
Similarly, let g(cid:2)sin vt.Then g(0)(cid:2)0, gr(cid:2)v cos vt.From this and (1) we obtain
l(gr )(cid:2)sl(g)(cid:2) vl(cos vt). Hence, l(sin vt)(cid:2)v l(cos vt)(cid:2) v . (cid:2)

Laplace Transform of the Integral of a Function
Differentiation and integration are inverse operations, and so are multiplication and division.
Since differentiation of a function f(t)(roughly) corresponds to multiplication of its transform
l( f )by s, we expect integration of f(t)to correspond to division of l( f )by s:

from which the second follows by taking the inverse transform on both sides. (cid:2)

Differential Equations, Initial Value Problems
Let us now discuss how the Laplace transform method solves ODEs and initial value
problems. We consider an initial value problem

where a and b are constant. Here r(t) is the given input (driving force) applied to the
mechanical or electrical system and y(t)is the output(response to the input) to be obtained.
In Laplace’s method we do three steps:
Step 1. Setting up the subsidiary equation.This is an algebraic equation for the transform
Y(cid:2)l(y) obtained by transforming (5) by means of (1) and (2), namely,
s2Y(cid:5)sy(0)(cid:5)yr (0) (cid:7)a sY(cid:5)y(0) (cid:7)bY(cid:2)R(s)
3 4 3 4
where R(s)(cid:2)l(r). Collecting the Y-terms, we have the subsidiary equation
(s2(cid:7)as(cid:7)b)Y(cid:2)(s (cid:7)a)y(0)(cid:7)yr (0) (cid:7)R(s).
Step 2. Solution of the subsidiary equation by algebra. We divide by s2(cid:7)as(cid:7)b and
use the so-called transfer function
1 1
(6) Q(s)(cid:2) (cid:2) .
s2(cid:7)as(cid:7)b (s (cid:7)1a)2(cid:7)b(cid:5)1a2

(Qis often denoted by H, but we need Hmuch more frequently for other purposes.) This
gives the solution
(7) Y(s)(cid:2) (s (cid:7)a)y(0)(cid:7)yr (0) Q(s)(cid:7)R(s)Q(s).

If y(0)(cid:2)yr (0) (cid:2)0, this is simply Y(cid:2)RQ; hence
Y
l(output)
Q(cid:2) (cid:2)
R l(input)
and this explains the name of Q. Note that Q depends neither on r(t) nor on the initial
conditions (but only on a and b).
Step 3. Inversion of Y to
obtainy(cid:4)ll(cid:3)1(Y).We
reduce (7) (usually bypartial fractions
as in calculus) to a sum of terms whose inverses can be found from the tables (e.g., in
Sec. 6.1 or Sec. 6.9) or by a CAS, so that we obtain the solution
y(t)(cid:2)l(cid:3)1(Y)
of (5).

Advantages of the Laplace Method

homogeneous ODE. See Example 4.

EXAMPLE 6 Shifted Data Problems
This means initial value problems with initial conditions given at some t(cid:2)t (cid:6)0instead of t(cid:2)0.For such a
problem set t(cid:2)~ t(cid:7)t ,so that t(cid:2)t gives ~ t(cid:2)0and the Laplace transform 0 can be applied. For instance, solve
0 0
ys(cid:7)y(cid:2)2t, y(1p)(cid:2)1p, yr (1p)(cid:2)2(cid:5) 12.

Solution. We have t (cid:2)1pand we set t(cid:2)~ t(cid:7)1p.Then the problem is

~ ys(cid:7)~ y(cid:2)2(~ t(cid:7)1p), ~ y(0)(cid:2)1p, ~ yr (0)(cid:2)2(cid:5) 12
4 2
where ~ y(~ t )(cid:2)y(t). Using (2) and Table 6.1 and denoting the transform of ~ y by Y~ ,we see that the subsidiary
equation of the “shifted” initial value problem is
s2Y~ (cid:5)s # 1p(cid:5)(2(cid:5) 12)(cid:7)Y~ (cid:2) 2 (cid:7)1 2 p , thus (s2(cid:7)1)Y~ (cid:2) 2 (cid:7)1 2 p (cid:7)1 ps(cid:7)2(cid:5) 12.
2 s2 s s2 s 2
~
Solving this algebraically for Y,we obtain
Y~ (cid:2) 2 (cid:7) 1 2 p (cid:7) 1 2 ps (cid:7) 2(cid:5) 12 .
(s2(cid:7)1)s2 (s2(cid:7)1)s s2(cid:7)1 s2(cid:7)1
The inverse of the first two terms can be seen from Example 3 (with v(cid:2)1),and the last two terms give cos
and sin,
y~(cid:2)l(cid:3)1(Y~ )(cid:2)2(~ t(cid:5)sin ~ t )(cid:7)1p(1(cid:5)cos ~ t )(cid:7)1pcos ~ t(cid:7)(2(cid:5) 12) sin ~ t

(cid:2)2~ t(cid:7)1p(cid:5) 12 sin ~ t.

Now ~ t(cid:2)t(cid:5)1p, sin ~ t(cid:2) 1 (sin t(cid:5)cos t), so that the answer (the solution) is

Unit Step Function (Heaviside Function).
Second Shifting Theorem (t-Shifting)
This section and the next one are extremely important because we shall now reach the
point where the Laplace transform method shows its real power in applications and its
superiority over the classical approach of Chap. 2. The reason is that we shall introduce
two auxiliary functions, the unit step functionor Heaviside functionu(t (cid:5)a)(below) and
Dirac’s delta d(t(cid:5)a) (in Sec. 6.4). These functions are suitable for solving ODEs with
complicated right sides of considerable engineering interest, such as single waves, inputs
(driving forces) that are discontinuous or act for some time only, periodic inputs more
general than just cosine and sine, or impulsive forces acting for an instant (hammerblows,
for example).
(cid:5)
Unit Step Function (Heaviside Function) u(t a)
The unit step functionor Heaviside functionu(t (cid:5)a)is 0 for t(cid:11)a,has a jump of size
1 at t(cid:2)a (where we can leave it undefined), and is 1 for t(cid:6)a, in a formula:
0 if t(cid:11)a

case u(t(cid:5)a) for an arbitrary positive a. (For Heaviside, see Sec. 6.1.)
The transform of u(t (cid:5)a) follows directly from the defining integral in Sec. 6.1,

The unit step function is a typical “engineering function” made to measure for engineering
applications, which often involve functions (mechanical or electrical driving forces) that
are either “off” or “on.” Multiplying functions f(t)with u(t (cid:5)a),we can produce all sorts
of effects. The simple basic idea is illustrated in Figs. 120 and 121. In Fig. 120 the given
function is shown in (A). In (B) it is switched off between t(cid:2)0 and t(cid:2)2 (because
u(t(cid:5)2)(cid:2)0when t(cid:11)2)and is switched on beginning at t(cid:2)2.In (C) it is shifted to the
right by 2 units, say, for instance, by 2 sec, so that it begins 2 sec later in the same fashion
as before. More generally we have the following.
Let f(t)(cid:2)0 for all negative t. Then f(t (cid:5)a)u(t(cid:5)a) with a(cid:6)0 is f(t) shifted
(translated) to the right by the amount a.
Figure 121 shows the effect of many unit step functions, three of them in (A) and
infinitely many in (B) when continued periodically to the right; this is the effect of a
rectifier that clips off the negative half-waves of a sinuosidal voltage. CAUTION!Make
sure that you fully understand these figures, in particular the difference between parts (B)
and (C) of Fig. 120. Figure 120(C) will be applied next.

Time Shifting (t-Shifting): Replacing t by t a in f(t)
The first shifting theorem (“s-shifting”) in Sec. 6.1 concerned transforms F(s)(cid:2)l{f(t)}
and F(s(cid:5)a)(cid:2)l{eatf(t)}.The second shifting theorem will concern functions f(t)and
f(t(cid:5)a).Unit step functions are just tools, and the theorem will be needed to apply them
in connection with any other functions.

b
(4) l{f(t (cid:5)a)u(t(cid:5)a)}(cid:2)e(cid:3)asF(s).
Or, if we take the inverse on both sides, we can write
(4*) f(t (cid:5)a)u(t(cid:5)a)(cid:2) l(cid:3)1{e(cid:3)asF(s)}.
Practically speaking, if we know F(s),we can obtain the transform of (3) by multiplying
F(s)by e(cid:3)as.In Fig. 120, the transform of 5 sin tis F(s)(cid:2)5 (s2(cid:7)1),hence the shifted
>
function 5 sin (t (cid:5)2)u(t(cid:5)2) shown in Fig. 120(C) has the transform
e(cid:3)2sF(s)(cid:2)5e(cid:3)2s (s2(cid:7)1).
>
PROOF We prove Theorem 1. In (4), on the right, we use the definition of the Laplace transform,
writing t for t (to have t available later). Then, taking e(cid:3)as inside the integral, we have
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
e(cid:3)asF(s)(cid:2)e(cid:3)as e(cid:3)stf(t) dt(cid:2) e(cid:3)s(t(cid:7)a)f(t) dt.
0 0
Substituting t(cid:7)a(cid:2)t, thus t(cid:2)t(cid:5)a, dt(cid:2)dt in the integral (CAUTION, the lower
limit changes!), we obtain
(cid:2)(cid:2)
e(cid:3)asF(s)(cid:2) e(cid:3)stf(t (cid:5)a) dt.

220 CHAP. 6 Laplace Transforms
To make the right side into a Laplace transform, we must have an integral from 0 to (cid:3),
not from ato (cid:3). But this is easy. We multiply the integrand by u(t (cid:5)a). Then for tfrom
~
0 to a the integrand is 0, and we can write, with f as in (3),
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
~
e(cid:3)asF(s)(cid:2) e(cid:3)stf(t (cid:5)a)u(t(cid:5)a) dt (cid:2) e(cid:3)stf(t) dt.
0 0
(Do you now see why u(t (cid:5)a)appears?) This integral is the left side of (4), the Laplace
~
transform of f(t) in (3). This completes the proof. (cid:2)

Solution. Step 1. In terms of unit step fundctions,
f(t)(cid:2)2(1(cid:5)u(t(cid:5)1))(cid:7)1t2(u(t(cid:5)1)(cid:5)u(t(cid:5)1p))(cid:7)(cos t)u(t(cid:5)1p).
2 2 2
Indeed, 2(1(cid:5)u(t(cid:5)1))gives f(t)for 0(cid:11)t(cid:11)1, and so on.
Step 2. To apply Theorem 1, we must write each term in f(t)in the form f(t(cid:5)a)u(t(cid:5)a). Thus, 2(1(cid:5)u(t(cid:5)1))
remains as it is and gives the transform 2(1(cid:5)e(cid:3)s) s. Then

This is the current i(t)when 0(cid:11)t(cid:11)2p.It agrees for 0(cid:11)t(cid:11)2pwith that in Example 1 of Sec. 2.9 (except
for notation), which concerned the same RLC-circuit. Its graph in Fig. 63 in Sec. 2.9 shows that the exponential
terms decrease very rapidly. Note that the present amount of work was substantially less.
The second term I of Idiffers from the first term by the factor e(cid:3)2ps.Since cos 400(t(cid:5)2p)(cid:2)cos 400t

Short Impulses. Dirac’s Delta Function.
Partial Fractions
An airplane making a “hard” landing, a mechanical system being hit by a hammerblow,
a ship being hit by a single high wave, a tennis ball being hit by a racket, and many other
similar examples appear in everyday life. They are phenomena of an impulsive nature
where actions of forces—mechanical, electrical, etc.—are applied over short intervals
of time.
We can model such phenomena and problems by “Dirac’s delta function,” and solve
them very effecively by the Laplace transform.
To model situations of that type, we consider the function
1 k if a (cid:10)t(cid:10)a(cid:7)k
(1) f (t (cid:5)a)(cid:2) > (Fig. 132)
k
0 otherwise
(and later its limit as k:0). This function represents, for instance, a force of magnitude
1 k acting from t(cid:2)a to t(cid:2)a(cid:7)k, b where k is positive and small. In mechanics, the
>
integral of a force acting over a time interval a(cid:10)t(cid:10)a(cid:7)k is called the impulse of
theforce; similarly for electromotive forces E(t) acting on circuits. Since the blue rectangle
in Fig. 132 has area 1, the impulse of f in (1) is

226 CHAP. 6 Laplace Transforms
To find out what will happen if kbecomes smaller and smaller, we take the limit of f
k
as k:0 (k(cid:6)0). This limit is denoted by d(t (cid:5)a), that is,
d(t (cid:5)a)(cid:2) lim f (t (cid:5)a).
k:0
k
d(t(cid:5)a) is called the Dirac delta function2 or the unit impulse function.
d(t(cid:5)a) is not a function in the ordinary sense as used in calculus, but a so-called
generalized function.2To see this, we note that the impulse I of f is 1, so that from (1)
k k
and (2) by taking the limit as k:0 we obtain
(cid:3) if t(cid:2)a (cid:2)(cid:2)
(3) d(t(cid:5)a)(cid:2) and d(t (cid:5)a) dt (cid:2)1,
0 otherwise
0
but from calculus we know that a function which is everywhere 0 except at a single point
b
must have the integral equal to 0. Nevertheless, in impulse problems, it is convenient to
operate on d(t(cid:5)a)as though it were an ordinary function. In particular, for a continuous
function g(t) one uses the property [often called the sifting property of d(t (cid:5)a), not to
be confused with shifting]
(cid:2)(cid:2)
(4) g(t)d(t(cid:5)a) dt (cid:2)g(a)
0
which is plausible by (2).
To obtain the Laplace transform of d(t (cid:5)a), we write
1
f (t (cid:5)a)(cid:2) u(t (cid:5)a)(cid:5)u(t (cid:5)(a(cid:7)k))
k k 3 4
and take the transform [see (2)]

l{f (t (cid:5)a)} (cid:2) e(cid:3)as(cid:5)e(cid:3)(a(cid:7)k)s (cid:2)e(cid:3)as .
k ks 3 4 ks
We now take the limit as k:0.By l’Hôpital’s rule the quotient on the right has the limit
1 (differentiate the numerator and the denominator separately with respect to k, obtaining
se(cid:3)ks and s, respectively, and use se(cid:3)ks s:1 as k:0). Hence the right side has the
limit e(cid:3)as. This suggests defining the tra> nsform of d(t (cid:5)a) by this limit, that is,
(5) l{d(t (cid:5)a)} (cid:2)e(cid:3)as.
The unit step and unit impulse functions can now be used on the right side of ODEs
modeling mechanical or electrical systems, as we illustrate next.
2PAUL DIRAC (1902–1984), English physicist, was awarded the Nobel Prize [jointly with the Austrian
ERWIN SCHRÖDINGER (1887–1961)] in 1933 for his work in quantum mechanics.
Generalized functions are also called distributions. Their theory was created in 1936 by the Russian
mathematician SERGEI L’VOVICH SOBOLEV (1908–1989), and in 1945, under wider aspects, by the French
mathematician LAURENT SCHWARTZ (1915–2002).

We have seen that the solution Y of a subsidiary equation usually appears as a quotient

EXAMPLE 4 Unrepeated Complex Factors. Damped Forced Vibrations
Solve the initial value problem for a damped mass–spring system acted upon by a sinusoidal force for some
time interval (Fig. 136),

Solution. From Table 6.1, (1), (2) in Sec. 6.2, and the second shifting theorem in Sec. 6.3, we obtain the

We determine A, B, M, N. Equating the coefficients of each power of son both sides gives the four equations

Convolution. Integral Equations
Convolution has to do with the multiplication of transforms. The situation is as follows.
Addition of transforms provides no problem; we know that l( f (cid:7)g)(cid:2)l( f ) (cid:7)l(g).
Now multiplication of transforms occurs frequently in connection with ODEs, integral
equations, and elsewhere. Then we usually know l( f )and l(g)and would like to know
the function whose transform is the product l( f )l(g). We might perhaps guess that it
is fg, but this is false. The transform of a product is generally different from the product
of the transforms of the factors,
l( fg) (cid:13)l( f )l(g) in general.
To see this take f(cid:2)etand g(cid:2)1. Then fg(cid:2)et, l( fg) (cid:2)1 (s (cid:5)1), but l( f ) (cid:2)1 (s(cid:5)1)
> >
and l(1) (cid:2)1 sgive l( f )l(g)(cid:2)1 (s2(cid:5)s).

According to the next theorem, the correct answer is that l( f )l(g)is the transform of
the convolutionof fand g, denoted by the standard notation f * gand defined by the integral

THEOREM 1 Convolution Theorem
If two functions f and g satisfy the assumption in the existence theorem in Sec. 6.1,
so that their transforms F and G exist, the product H(cid:2)FG is the transform of h
given by (1). (Proof after Example 2.)

PROOF We prove the Convolution Theorem 1. CAUTION! Note which ones are the variables
of integration! We can denote them as we want, for instance, by t and p, and write

F(s) (cid:2) e(cid:3)stf(t) dt and G(s)(cid:2) e(cid:3)spg(p) dp.
0 0
We now set t(cid:2)p(cid:7)t, where t is at first constant. Then p(cid:2)t(cid:5)t, and t varies from
t to (cid:3). Thus
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
G(s)(cid:2) e(cid:3)s(t(cid:3)t)g(t (cid:5)t) dt (cid:2)est e(cid:3)stg(t (cid:5)t) dt.
t t
t in F and t in G vary independently. Hence we can insert the G-integral into the
F-integral. Cancellation of e(cid:3)st and est then gives
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
F(s)G(s)(cid:2) e(cid:3)stf(t)est e(cid:3)stg(t (cid:5)t)dt dt(cid:2) f(t) e(cid:3)stg(t (cid:5)t)dt dt.

Here we integrate for fixed tover tfrom tto (cid:3) and then over tfrom 0 to (cid:3). This is the
blue region in Fig. 141. Under the assumption on f and g the order of integration can be
reversed (see Ref. [A5] for a proof using uniform convergence). We then integrate first
over t from 0 to t and then over t from 0 to (cid:3), that is,
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)t (cid:2)(cid:2)
F(s)G(s)(cid:2) e(cid:3)st f(t)g(t(cid:5)t)dt dt (cid:2) e(cid:3)sth(t)dt(cid:2)l(h)(cid:2)H(s).

convolution.
EXAMPLE 4 Repeated Complex Factors. Resonance
In an undamped mass–spring system, resonance occurs if the frequency of the driving force equals the natural
frequency of the system. Then the model is (see Sec. 2.8)
ys(cid:7)v 02 y(cid:2)K sin v 0t
where v2(cid:2)k m, kis the spring constant, and mis the mass of the body attached to the spring. We assume
y(0)(cid:2)00
and
y>r
(0)(cid:2)0, for simplicity. Then the subsidiary equation is
Kv Kv

This is a transform as in Example 2 with v(cid:2)v and multiplied by Kv . Hence from Example 2 we can see

directly that the solution of our problem is
Kv sin v t K

We see that the first term grows without bound. Clearly, in the case of resonance such a term must occur. (See
(cid:2)
also a similar kind of solution in Fig. 55 in Sec. 2.8.)
Application to Nonhomogeneous Linear ODEs
Nonhomogeneous linear ODEs can now be solved by a general method based on
convolution by which the solution is obtained in the form of an integral. To see this, recall
from Sec. 6.2 that the subsidiary equation of the ODE
(2) ys (cid:7)ayr (cid:7)by(cid:2)r(t) (a, b constant)
has the solution [(7) in Sec. 6.2]
Y(s) (cid:2)[(s (cid:7)a)y(0)(cid:7)yr (0)]Q(s)(cid:7)R(s)Q(s)
with R(s)(cid:2)l(r)and Q(s)(cid:2)1 (s2(cid:7)as(cid:7)b)the transfer function. Inversion of the first
term Á provides no difficu> lty; depending on whether 1a2(cid:5)b is positive, zero, or
3 4 4
negative, its inverse will be a linear combination of two exponential functions, or of the
form (c 1(cid:7)c 2t)e(cid:3)at >2, or a damped oscillation, respectively. The interesting term is
R(s)Q(s) because r(t) can have various forms of practical importance, as we shall see. If
y(0)(cid:2)0 and yr (0) (cid:2)0, then Y(cid:2)RQ, and the convolution theorem gives the solution
(cid:2)t
(3) y(t)(cid:2) q(t (cid:5)t)r(t) dt.

EXAMPLE 5 Response of a Damped Vibrating System to a Single Square Wave
Using convolution, determine the response of the damped mass–spring system modeled by
ys(cid:7)3yr(cid:7)2y(cid:2)r(t), r(t)(cid:2)1if 1(cid:11)t(cid:11)2and 0 otherwise, y(0)(cid:2)yr (0)(cid:2)0.
This system with an input(a driving force) that acts for some time only(Fig. 143) has been solved by partial
fraction reduction in Sec. 6.4 (Example 1).
Solution by Convolution. The transfer function and its inverse are

Hence the convolution integral (3) is (except for the limits of integration)

y(t)(cid:4)e(cid:2)(t(cid:2)2)(cid:2)1e(cid:2)2(t(cid:2)2)(cid:2)(e(cid:2)(t(cid:2)1)(cid:2)1e(cid:2)2(t(cid:2)1)).

Figure 143 shows the input (the square wave) and the interesting output, which is zero from 0 to 1, then increases,
reaches a maximum (near 2.6) after the input has become zero (why?), and finally decreases to zero in a monotone

Integral Equations
Convolution also helps in solving certain integral equations, that is, equations in which the
unknown function y(t)appears in an integral (and perhaps also outside of it). This concerns
equations with an integral of the form of a convolution. Hence these are special and it suffices
to explain the idea in terms of two examples and add a few problems in the problem set.

Solution. From (1) we see that the given equation can be written as a convolution, y(cid:2)y * sin t(cid:4)t. Writing
Y(cid:4)l(y)and applying the convolution theorem, we obtain

3If the upper limit of integration is variable, the equation is named after the Italian mathematician VITO
VOLTERRA (1860–1940), and if that limit is constant, the equation is named after the Swedish mathematician
ERIK IVAR FREDHOLM (1866–1927). “Of the second kind (first kind)” indicates that y occurs (does not
occur) outside of the integral.

Differentiation and Integration of Transforms.
ODEs with Variable Coefficients
The variety of methods for obtaining transforms and inverse transforms and their
application in solving ODEs is surprisingly large. We have seen that they include direct
integration, the use of linearity (Sec. 6.1), shifting (Secs. 6.1, 6.3), convolution (Sec. 6.5),
and differentiation and integration of functions f(t) (Sec. 6.2). In this section, we shall
consider operations of somewhat lesser importance. They are the differentiation and
integration of transforms F(s) and corresponding operations for functions f(t). We show
how they are applied to ODEs with variable coefficients.
Differentiation of Transforms
It can be shown that, if a function f(t) satisfies the conditions of the existence theorem in
Sec. 6.1, then the derivative Fr (s)(cid:2)dF dsof the transform F(s) (cid:2)l( f )can be obtained
>
by differentiating F(s) under the integral sign with respect to s (proof in Ref. [GenRef4]
listed in App. 1). Thus, if
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
F(s)(cid:2) e(cid:3)stf(t) dt, then Fr (s)(cid:2)(cid:5) e(cid:3)sttf(t) dt.
0 0
Consequently, if l( f ) (cid:2)F(s), then
(1) l{tf(t)} (cid:2)(cid:5)Fr (s), hence l(cid:3)1{Fr (s)} (cid:2)(cid:5)tf(t)
where the second formula is obtained by applying
l(cid:3)1on
both sides of the first formula.
In this way, differentiation of the transform of a function corresponds to the multiplication
of the function by (cid:5)t.
EXAMPLE 1 Differentiation of Transforms. Formulas 21–23 in Sec. 6.9
We shall derive the following three formulas.

SEC. 6.6 Differentiation and Integration of Transforms. ODEs with Variable Coefficients 239
Dividing by 2band using the linearity of l, we obtain (3).
Formulas (2) and (4) are obtained as follows. From (1) and formula 7 (with v(cid:2)b)in Table 6.1 we find
(s2(cid:3)b2)(cid:4)2s2 s2(cid:4)b2
(5) l(t cos bt)(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:2) .
(s2(cid:3)b2)2 (s2(cid:3)b2)2
From this and formula 8 (with v(cid:2)b) in Table 6.1 we have
1 s2(cid:4)b2 1
l t cos bt (cid:6) sin bt (cid:2) (cid:6) .
a b b (s2(cid:3)b2)2 ˛s2(cid:3)b2
On the right we now take the common denominator. Then we see that for the plus sign the numerator becomes
s2(cid:4)b2(cid:3)s2(cid:3)b2(cid:2)2s2, so that (4) follows by division by 2. Similarly, for the minus sign the numerator
takes the form s2(cid:4)b2(cid:4)s2(cid:4)b2(cid:2)(cid:4)2b2, and we obtain (2). This agrees with Example 2 in Sec. 6.5. (cid:2)
Integration of Transforms
Similarly, if f(t)satisfies the conditions of the existence theorem in Sec. 6.1 and the limit
of f(t) t, as t approaches 0 from the right, exists, then for s(cid:5)k,
>
f(t)

e t f e f t
s s
In this way, integration of the transform of a function f(t) corresponds to the division of
f(t) by t.
We indicate how (6) is obtained. From the definition it follows that
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
F(s(cid:2)) ds(cid:2)(cid:2) e(cid:3)~ stf(t) dt ds(cid:2),
c d
s s 0
and it can be shown (see Ref. [GenRef4] in App. 1) that under the above assumptions we
may reverse the order of integration, that is,
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
F(s(cid:2)) ds(cid:2)(cid:2) e(cid:3)~ stf(t) ds(cid:2) dt(cid:2) f(t) e(cid:3)~ st ds(cid:2) dt.

Special Linear ODEs with Variable Coefficients
Formula (1) can be used to solve certain ODEs with variable coefficients. The idea is this.
Let l(y)(cid:2)Y. Then l(yr )(cid:2)sY(cid:5)y(0) (see Sec. 6.2). Hence by (1),
(7) l(tyr )(cid:2)(cid:5) d [sY(cid:5)y(0)](cid:2)(cid:5)Y(cid:5)sdY .
ds ds
Similarly, l(ys )(cid:2)s2Y(cid:5)sy(0) (cid:5)yr (0) and by (1)
(8) l(tys )(cid:2) (cid:5) d [s2Y(cid:5)sy(0) (cid:5)yr (0)](cid:2)(cid:5)2sY(cid:5)s2 dY (cid:7)y(0).
ds ds
Hence if an ODE has coefficients such as at(cid:7)b, the subsidiary equation is a first-order
ODE for Y, which is sometimes simpler than the given second-order ODE. But if the latter
has coefficients at2(cid:7)bt (cid:7)c, then two applications of (1) would give a second-order
ODE for Y, and this shows that the present method works well only for rather special
ODEs with variable coefficients. An important ODE for which the method is advantageous
is the following.

Other systems of ODEs of practical importance can be solved by the Laplace transform
method in a similar way, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors, as we had to determine them
in Chap. 4, will come out automatically, as we have seen in Example 1.

Systems of ODEs of higher order can be solved by the Laplace transform method in a
similar fashion. As an important application, typical of many similar mechanical systems,
we consider coupled vibrating masses on springs.

EXAMPLE 3 Model of Two Masses on Springs (Fig. 146)
The mechanical system in Fig. 146 consists of two bodies of mass 1 on three springs of the same spring constant
kand of negligibly small masses of the springs. Also damping is assumed to be practically zero. Then the model
of the physical system is the system of ODEs
ys(cid:2)(cid:5)ky (cid:7)k(y (cid:5)y )
1 1 2 1
(3)
ys(cid:2)(cid:5)k(y (cid:5)y )(cid:5)ky .
2 2 1 2
Here y and y are the displacements of the bodies from their positions of static equilibrium. These ODEs
1 2
follow from Newton’s second law, Mass(cid:16)Acceleration(cid:2)Force,as in Sec. 2.4 for a single body. We again
regard downward forces as positive and upward as negative. On the upper body, (cid:5)ky is the force of the
1
upper spring and k(y (cid:5)y )that of the middle spring, y (cid:5)y being the net change in spring length—think
2 1 2 1
this over before going on. On the lower body, (cid:5)k(y (cid:5)y )is the force of the middle spring and (cid:5)ky that
2 1 2
of the lower spring.
We shall determine the solution corresponding to the initial conditions y (0)(cid:2)1,y (0)(cid:2)1,yr (0)(cid:2) 23k,
1 2 1
yr (0)(cid:2)(cid:5)23k. Let Y (cid:2)l(y )and Y (cid:2)l(y ). Then from (2) in Sec. 6.2 and the initial conditions we obtain
2 1 1 2 2
the subsidiary system
s2Y (cid:5)s(cid:5) 23k(cid:2)(cid:5)kY (cid:7)k(Y (cid:5)Y)
1 1 2 1
s2Y (cid:5)s(cid:7) 23k(cid:2)(cid:5)k(Y (cid:5)Y)(cid:5)kY.
2 2 1 2
This system of linear algebraic equations in the unknowns Y and Y may be written

Elimination (or Cramer’s rule in Sec. 7.7) yields the solution, which we can expand in terms of partial fractions,

We see that the motion of each mass is harmonic (the system is undamped!), being the superposition of a “slow”
(cid:2)
oscillation and a “rapid” oscillation.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Laplace Transforms
The main purpose of Laplace transforms is the solution of differential equations and
systems of such equations, as well as corresponding initial value problems. The
Laplace transform F(s) (cid:2)l( f ) of a function f(t) is defined by
(cid:2)(cid:2)
(1) F(s) (cid:2)l( f ) (cid:2) e(cid:3)stf(t) dt (Sec. 6.1).
0
This definition is motivated by the property that the differentiation of fwith respect
to t corresponds to the multiplication of the transform F by s; more precisely,
l( fr )(cid:2)sl( f ) (cid:5)f(0)
(2) (Sec. 6.2)
l( fs )(cid:2)s2l( f ) (cid:5)sf(0) (cid:5)fr (0)
etc. Hence by taking the transform of a given differential equation
(3) ys (cid:7)ayr (cid:7)by(cid:2)r(t) (a, b constant)
and writing l(y)(cid:2)Y(s), we obtain the subsidiary equation
(4) (s2(cid:7)as(cid:7)b)Y(cid:2)l(r) (cid:7)sf(0) (cid:7)fr (0) (cid:7)af(0).
Here, in obtaining the transform l(r)we can get help from the small table in Sec.6.1
or the larger table in Sec. 6.9. This is the first step. In the second step we solve the
subsidiary equation algebraicallyfor Y(s). In the third step we determine the inverse
transform
y(t)(cid:2)l(cid:3)1(Y),
that is, the solution of the problem. This is generally
thehardest step, and in it we may again use one of those two tables. Y(s)will often
be a rational function, so that we can obtain the inverse
l(cid:3)1(Y)
by partial fraction
reduction (Sec. 6.4) if we see no simpler way.
The Laplace method avoids the determination of a general solution of the
homogeneous ODE, and we also need not determine values of arbitrary constants
in a general solution from initial conditions; instead, we can insert the latter directly
into (4). Two further facts account for the practical importance of the Laplace
transform. First, it has some basic properties and resulting techniques that simplify
the determination of transforms and inverses. The most important of these properties
are listed in Sec. 6.8, together with references to the corresponding sections. More
on the use of unit step functions and Dirac’s delta can be found in Secs. 6.3 and
6.4, and more on convolution in Sec. 6.5. Second, due to these properties, the present
method is particularly suitable for handling right sides r(t) given by different
expressions over different intervals of time, for instance, when r(t)is a square wave
or an impulse or of a form such as r(t)(cid:2)cos t if 0(cid:10)t(cid:10)4p and 0 elsewhere.
The application of the Laplace transform to systems of ODEs is shown in Sec. 6.7.
(The application to PDEs follows in Sec. 12.12.)

Matricesand vectors, which underlie linear algebra(Chaps. 7 and 8), allow us to represent
numbers or functions in an ordered and compact form. Matrices can hold enormous amounts
of data—think of a network of millions of computer connections or cell phone connections—
in a form that can be rapidly processed by computers. The main topic of Chap. 7 is how
to solve systems of linear equations using matrices. Concepts of rank, basis, linear
transformations, and vector spaces are closely related. Chapter 8 deals with eigenvalue
problems. Linear algebra is an active field that has many applications in engineering
physics, numerics (see Chaps. 20–22), economics, and others.
Chapters 9 and 10 extend calculus to vector calculus. We start with vectors from linear
algebra and develop vector differential calculus. We differentiate functions of several
variables and discuss vector differential operations such as grad, div, and curl. Chapter 10
extends regular integration to integration over curves, surfaces, and solids, thereby
obtaining new types of integrals. Ingenious theorems by Gauss, Green, and Stokes allow
us to transform these integrals into one another.
Software suitable for linear algebra(Lapack, Maple, Mathematica, Matlab) can be found
in the list at the opening of Part E of the book if needed.
Numeric linear algebra (Chap. 20) can be studied directly after Chap. 7 or 8 because
Chap. 20 is independent of the other chapters in Part E on numerics.

Linear Algebra: Matrices,
Vectors, Determinants.
Linear Systems
Linear algebrais a fairly extensive subject that covers vectors and matrices, determinants,
systems of linear equations, vector spaces and linear transformations, eigenvalue problems,
and other topics. As an area of study it has a broad appeal in that it has many applications
in engineering, physics, geometry, computer science, economics, and other areas. It also
contributes to a deeper understanding of mathematics itself.
Matrices, which are rectangular arrays of numbers or functions, and vectors are the
main tools of linear algebra. Matrices are important because they let us express large
amounts of data and functions in an organized and concise form. Furthermore, since
matrices are single objects, we denote them by single letters and calculate with them
directly. All these features have made matrices and vectors very popular for expressing
scientific and mathematical ideas.
The chapter keeps a good mix between applications (electric networks, Markov
processes, traffic flow, etc.) and theory. Chapter 7 is structured as follows: Sections 7.1
and 7.2 provide an intuitive introduction to matrices and vectors and their operations,
including matrix multiplication. The next block of sections, that is, Secs. 7.3–7.5 provide
the most important method for solving systems of linear equations by the Gauss
elimination method. This method is a cornerstone of linear algebra, and the method
itself and variants of it appear in different areas of mathematics and in many applications.
It leads to a consideration of the behavior of solutions and concepts such as rank of a
matrix, linear independence, and bases. We shift to determinants, a topic that has
declined in importance, in Secs. 7.6 and 7.7. Section 7.8 covers inverses of matrices.
The chapter ends with vector spaces, inner product spaces, linear transformations, and
composition of linear transformations. Eigenvalue problems follow in Chap. 8.
COMMENT. Numeric linear algebra (Secs. 20.1–20.5) can be studied immediately
after this chapter.

7.1
Matrices, Vectors:
Addition and Scalar Multiplication
The basic concepts and rules of matrix and vector algebra are introduced in Secs. 7.1 and
7.2 and are followed by linear systems(systems of linear equations), a main application,
in Sec. 7.3.
Let us first take a leisurely look at matrices before we formalize our discussion. A matrix
is a rectangular array of numbers or functions which we will enclose in brackets. For example,
a a a
11 12 13
0.3 1 (cid:4)5
, a a a ,
c 0 (cid:4)0.2 16 d 21 22 23

e(cid:2)x 2x2 4

ce6x 4x d 1 2 3 c1d

are matrices. The numbers (or functions) are called entries or, less commonly, elements
of the matrix. The first matrix in (1) has two rows,which are the horizontal lines of entries.
Furthermore, it has three columns, which are the vertical lines of entries. The second and
third matrices are square matrices, which means that each has as many rows as columns—
3 and 2, respectively. The entries of the second matrix have two indices, signifying their
location within the matrix. The first index is the number of the row and the second is the
number of the column, so that together the entry’s position is uniquely identified. For
example, a (read a two three) is in Row 2 and Column 3, etc. The notation is standard
23
and applies to all matrices, including those that are not square.
Matrices having just a single row or column are called vectors. Thus, the fourth matrix
in (1) has just one row and is called a row vector. The last matrix in (1) has just one
column and is called a column vector. Because the goal of the indexing of entries was
to uniquely identify the position of an element within a matrix, one index suffices for
vectors, whether they are row or column vectors. Thus, the third entry of the row vector
in (1) is denoted by a .

Matrices are handy for storing and processing data in applications. Consider the
following two common examples.
EXAMPLE 1 Linear Systems, a Major Application of Matrices
We are given a system of linear equations, briefly a linear system, such as
4x (cid:3)6x (cid:3)9x (cid:2) 6
1 2 3
6x (cid:4)2x (cid:2)20
1 3
5x (cid:4)8x (cid:3) x (cid:2)10
1 2 3
where x , x , x are the unknowns. We form the coefficient matrix, call it A,by listing the coefficients of the
1 2 3
unknowns in the position in which they appear in the linear equations. In the second equation, there is no
unknown x ,which means that the coefficient of x is 0 and hence in matrix A, a (cid:2)0,Thus,

A(cid:2) 6 0 (cid:4)2 . We form another matrix A (cid:2) 6 0 (cid:4)2 20
5 (cid:4)8 1 5 (cid:4)8 1 10
by augmenting AwiDth the right sideTs of the linear system and call it the aDugmented matrix of Tthe system.
~ ~
Since we can go back and recapture the system of linear equations directly from the augmented matrix A, A
contains all the information of the system and can thus be used to solve the linear system. This means that we
can just use the augmented matrix to do the calculations needed to solve the system. We shall explain this in
detail in Sec. 7.3. Meanwhile you may verify by substitution that the solution is x (cid:2)3, x (cid:2)1, x (cid:2)(cid:4)1.
1 2 2 3
The notation x , x , x for the unknowns is practical but not essential; we could choose x, y, zor some other
1 2 3 (cid:2)
letters.
EXAMPLE 2 Sales Figures in Matrix Form

Sales figures for three products I, II, III in a store on Monday (Mon), Tuesday (Tues), may for each week
be arranged in a matrix

If the company has 10 stores, wDe can set up 10 such matrices, one for each storeT. Then, by adding corresponding
entries of these matrices, we can get a matrix showing the total sales of each product on each day. Can you think
of other data which can be stored in matrix form? For instance, in transportation or storage problems? Or in
(cid:2)
listing distances in a network of roads?
General Concepts and Notations
Let us formalize what we just have discussed. We shall denote matrices by capital boldface
letters A, B, C,Á , or by writing the general entry in brackets; thus A(cid:2)[a ], and so
jk
on. By an m(cid:3)n matrix (read m by n matrix) we mean a matrix with m rows and n
columns—rows always come first! m(cid:5)nis called the sizeof the matrix. Thus an m(cid:5)n
matrix is of the form
Á
a a a
11 12 1n
Á
a a a
21 22 2n
(2) A(cid:2) a (cid:2) .
3 jk4 # # Á #

a a a
m1 m2 mn
E U
The matrices in (1) are of sizes 2(cid:5)3, 3(cid:5)3, 2(cid:5)2, 1(cid:5)3, and 2(cid:5)1, respectively.
Each entry in (2) has two subscripts. The first is the row numberand the second is the
column number. Thus a is the entry in Row 2 and Column 1.
21
If m(cid:2)n,we call Aan n(cid:5)nsquare matrix. Then its diagonal containing the entries
Á
a , a , , a is called the main diagonal of A. Thus the main diagonals of the two
11 22 nn
square matrices in (1) are a , a , a and
e(cid:2)x,
4x, respectively.
11 22 33
Square matrices are particularly important, as we shall see. A matrix of any size m(cid:5)n
is called a rectangular matrix; this includes square matrices as a special case.

Vectors
A vectoris a matrix with only one row or column. Its entries are called the components
Á
of the vector. We shall denote vectors by lowercase boldface letters a, b, or by its
general component in brackets, a(cid:2) a , and so on. Our special vectors in (1) suggest
3 j4
that a (general) row vector is of the form
a(cid:2) a a Á a . For instance, a(cid:2) (cid:4)2 5 0.8 0 1 .

Addition and Scalar Multiplication
of Matrices and Vectors
What makes matrices and vectors really useful and particularly suitable for computers is
the fact that we can calculate with them almost as easily as with numbers. Indeed, we
now introduce rules for addition and for scalar multiplication (multiplication by numbers)
that were suggested by practical applications. (Multiplication of matrices by matrices
follows in the next section.) We first need the concept of equality.
DEFINITION Equality of Matrices
Two matrices A(cid:2) a and B(cid:2) b are equal, written A(cid:2)B, if and only if
3 jk4 3 jk4
they have the same size and the corresponding entries are equal, that is, a (cid:2)b ,
11 11
a (cid:2)b ,and so on. Matrices that are not equal are called different.Thus, matrices
12 12
of different sizes are always different.
EXAMPLE 3 Equality of Matrices

DEFINITION Addition of Matrices
The sum of two matrices A(cid:2) a and B(cid:2) b of the same size is written
3 jk4 3 jk4
A(cid:3)B and has the entries a (cid:3)b obtained by adding the corresponding entries
jk jk
of A and B. Matrices of different sizes cannot be added.
As a special case, the sum a (cid:3) b of two row vectors or two column vectors, which
must have the same number of components, is obtained by adding the corresponding
components.
EXAMPLE 4 Addition of Matrices and Vectors

An application of matrix addition was suggested in Example 2. Many others will follow.
DEFINITION Scalar Multiplication (Multiplication by a Number)
The productof anym(cid:5)nmatrix A(cid:2) a and any scalarc(number c) is written
3 jk4
cA and is the m(cid:5)n matrix cA(cid:2) ca obtained by multiplying each entry of A
3 jk4
by c.
Here ((cid:4)1)A is simply written (cid:4)A and is called the negative of A. Similarly, ((cid:4)k)A is
written (cid:4)kA. Also, A(cid:3)((cid:4)B)is written A(cid:4)Band is called the differenceof Aand B
(which must have the same size!).

Rules for Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication. From the familiar laws for the
addition of numbers we obtain similar laws for the addition of matrices of the same size
m(cid:5)n, namely,
(a) A(cid:3)B(cid:2)B(cid:3)A
(b) (A(cid:3)B)(cid:3)C(cid:2)A(cid:3)(B (cid:3)C) (written A(cid:3)B(cid:3)C)
(3)
(c) A(cid:3)0(cid:2)A
(d) A(cid:3)((cid:4)A)(cid:2)0.
Here 0denotes the zero matrix(of size m(cid:5)n), that is, the m(cid:5)nmatrix with all entries
zero. If m(cid:2)1 or n(cid:2)1, this is a vector, called a zero vector.
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 261
SEC. 7.1 Matrices, Vectors: Addition and Scalar Multiplication 261
Hence matrix addition is commutative and associative [by (3a) and (3b)].

Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication means that one multiplies matrices by matrices. Its definition is
standard but it looks artificial. Thus you have to study matrix multiplication carefully,
multiply a few matrices together for practice until you can understand how to do it. Here
then is the definition. (Motivation follows later.)
DEFINITION Multiplication of a Matrix by a Matrix
The product C(cid:2)AB(in this order) of anm(cid:5)nmatrix A(cid:2) a times anr(cid:5)p
3 jk4
matrix B(cid:2) b is defined if and only if r(cid:2)n and is then the m(cid:5)p matrix

, p.
l(cid:2)1
The condition r(cid:2)nmeans that the second factor, B, must have as many rows as the first
factor has columns, namely n. A diagram of sizes that shows when matrix multiplication
is possible is as follows:
A B (cid:2) C
m(cid:5)n n(cid:5)p (cid:2) m(cid:5)p .
3 43 4 3 4
The entry c in (1) is obtained by multiplying each entry in the jth row of A by the
jk
corresponding entry in the kth column of Band then adding these nproducts. For instance,
c (cid:2)a b (cid:3)a b (cid:3) Á (cid:3)a b ,and so on. One calls this briefly a multiplication
21 21 11 22 21 2n n1

where we shaded the entries that contribute to the calculation of entry c just discussed.

Matrix multiplication will be motivated by its use in linear transformations in this
section and more fully in Sec. 7.9.
Let us illustrate the main points of matrix multiplication by some examples. Note that
matrix multiplication also includes multiplying a matrix by a vector, since, after all,
a vector is a special matrix.

EXAMPLE 4 CAUTION!Matrix Multiplication Is Not Commutative, AB(cid:4)BAin General
This is illustrated by Examples 1 and 2, where one of the two products is not even defined, and by Example 3,
where the two products have different sizes. But it also holds for square matrices. For instance,
1 1 (cid:4)1 1 0 0 (cid:4)1 1 1 1 99 99
(cid:2) but (cid:2) .
c100 100d c 1 (cid:4)1d c0 0d c 1 (cid:4)1d c100 100d c(cid:4)99 (cid:4)99d
It is interesting that this also shows that AB(cid:2)0does notnecessarily imply BA(cid:2)0or A(cid:2)0or B(cid:2)0. We
(cid:2)
shall discuss this further in Sec. 7.8, along with reasons when this happens.
Our examples show that in matrix products theorder of factorsmust always be observed
very carefully. Otherwise matrix multiplication satisfies rules similar to those for numbers,
namely.
(a) (kA)B(cid:2)k(AB)(cid:2)A(kB) written kAB or AkB
(b) A(BC)(cid:2)(AB)C written ABC

(c) (A(cid:3)B)C(cid:2)AC (cid:3)BC

provided A, B, and Care such that the expressions on the left are defined; here, kis any
scalar. (2b) is called the associative law. (2c) and (2d) are called the distributive laws.
Since matrix multiplication is a multiplication of rows into columns, we can write the
defining formula (1) more compactly as
(3) c (cid:2)ab , j(cid:2)1,Á , m; k(cid:2)1,Á , p,

Parallel processing of products on the computer is facilitated by a variant of (3) for
computing C(cid:2)AB, which is used by standard algorithms (such as in Lapack). In this
method, A is used as given, B is taken in terms of its column vectors, and the product is
computed columnwise; thus,
(5) AB (cid:2)A b b Á b (cid:2) Ab Ab Á Ab .

Columns of B are then assigned to different processors (individually or several to

Motivation of Multiplication
by Linear Transformations
Let us now motivate the “unnatural” matrix multiplication by its use in linear
transformations. For n(cid:2)2 variables these transformations are of the form
y (cid:2)a x (cid:3)a x
1 11 1 12 2
(6*)
y (cid:2)a x (cid:3)a x
2 21 1 22 2
and suffice to explain the idea. (For general n they will be discussed in Sec. 7.9.) For
instance, (6*) may relate an x x -coordinate system to a y y -coordinate system in the
1 2 1 2
plane. In vectorial form we can write (6*) as
y a a x a x (cid:3)a x
1 11 12 1 11 1 12 2
(6) y(cid:2) (cid:2)Ax (cid:2) (cid:2) .
cy d ca a d cx d ca x (cid:3)a x d

c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 266
266 CHAP. 7 Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems
Now suppose further that the x x -system is related to a w w -system by another linear
1 2 1 2
transformation, say,
x b b w b w (cid:3)b w
1 11 12 1 11 1 12 2
(7) x(cid:2) (cid:2)Bw(cid:2) (cid:2) .
cx d cb b d cw d cb w (cid:3)b w d
2 21 22 2 21 1 22 2
Then the y y -system is related to the w w -system indirectly via the x x -system, and
1 2 1 2 1 2
we wish to express this relation directly. Substitution will show that this direct relation is
a linear transformation, too, say,
c c w c w (cid:3)c w
11 12 1 11 1 12 2
(8) y(cid:2)Cw (cid:2) (cid:2) .
cc c d cw d cc w (cid:3)c w d
21 22 2 21 1 22 2
Indeed, substituting (7) into (6), we obtain
y (cid:2)a (b w (cid:3)b w )(cid:3)a (b w (cid:3)b w )
1 11 11 1 12 2 12 21 1 22 2
(cid:2)(a b (cid:3)a b )w (cid:3)(a b (cid:3)a b )w
11 11 12 21 1 11 12 12 22 2
y (cid:2)a (b w (cid:3)b w )(cid:3)a (b w (cid:3)b w )
2 21 11 1 12 2 22 21 1 22 2
(cid:2)(a b (cid:3)a b )w (cid:3)(a b (cid:3)a b )w .
21 11 22 21 1 21 12 22 22 2
Comparing this with (8), we see that
c (cid:2)a b (cid:3)a b c (cid:2)a b (cid:3)a b
11 11 11 12 21 12 11 12 12 22
c (cid:2)a b (cid:3)a b c (cid:2)a b (cid:3)a b .
21 21 11 22 21 22 21 12 22 22
This proves that C(cid:2)AB with the product defined as in (1). For larger matrix sizes the
idea and result are exactly the same. Only the number of variables changes. We then have
m variables y and n variables x and p variables w. The matrices A, B, and C(cid:2) AB then
have sizes m(cid:5)n, n(cid:5)p, and m(cid:5)p, respectively. And the requirement that C be the
product ABleads to formula (1) in its general form. This motivates matrix multiplication.
Transposition
We obtain the transpose of a matrix by writing its rows as columns (or equivalently its
columns as rows). This also applies to the transpose of vectors. Thus, a row vector becomes
a column vector and vice versa. In addition, for square matrices, we can also “reflect”
the elements along the main diagonal, that is, interchange entries that are symmetrically
positioned with respect to the main diagonal to obtain the transpose. Hence a becomes
12
a , a becomes a ,and so forth. Example 7 illustrates these ideas. Also note that, if A
21 31 13
is the given matrix, then we denote its transpose by AT.

DEFINITION Transposition of Matrices and Vectors
The transpose of an m(cid:5)n matrix A(cid:2) a is the n(cid:5)m matrix AT (read A
3 jk4
transpose) that has the firstrowof Aas its first column, the second rowof Aas its
second column, and so on. Thus the transpose of Ain (2) is AT(cid:2) a ,written out

As a special case, transposition converts row vectors to column vectors and conversely.
Transposition gives us a choice in that we can work either with the matrix or its
transpose, whichever is more convenient.
Rules for transposition are
(a) (AT)T(cid:2)A
(b) (A(cid:3)B)T(cid:2)AT(cid:3)BT
(10)
(c) (cA)T(cid:2)cAT
(d) (AB)T(cid:2)BTAT.
CAUTION! Note that in (10d) the transposed matrices are in reversed order.We leave
the proofs as an exercise in Probs. 9 and 10.
Special Matrices
Certain kinds of matrices will occur quite frequently in our work, and we now list the
most important ones of them.
Symmetric and Skew-Symmetric Matrices. Transposition gives rise to two useful
classes of matrices. Symmetricmatrices are square matrices whose transpose equals the
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 268
268 CHAP. 7 Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems
matrix itself. Skew-symmetric matrices are square matrices whose transpose equals
minus the matrix. Both cases are defined in (11) and illustrated by Example 8.
(11) AT(cid:2)A (thus a (cid:2)a ), AT(cid:2)(cid:4)A (thus a (cid:2)(cid:4)a , hence a (cid:2)0).

Symmetric matrices have several general properties which make them important. This will be seen as we
(cid:2)
proceed.
Triangular Matrices. Upper triangular matricesare square matrices that can have nonzero
entries only on and abovethe main diagonal, whereas any entry below the diagonal must be
zero. Similarly, lower triangular matricescan have nonzero entries only on and belowthe
main diagonal. Any entry on the main diagonal of a triangular matrix may be zero or not.

Diagonal Matrices. These are square matrices that can have nonzero entries only on
the main diagonal. Any entry above or below the main diagonal must be zero.
If all the diagonal entries of a diagonal matrix S are equal, say, c, we call S a scalar
matrixbecause multiplication of any square matrix Aof the same size by Shas the same
effect as the multiplication by a scalar, that is,
(12) AS (cid:2)SA (cid:2)cA.
In particular, a scalar matrix, whose entries on the main diagonal are all 1, is called a unit
matrix(or identity matrix) and is denoted by I or simply by I. For I, formula (12) becomes
n

Ais a stochastic matrix, that is, a square matrix with all entries nonnegative and all column sums equal to 1.
Our example concerns a Markov process,1that is, a process for which the probability of entering a certain state
depends only on the last state occupied (and the matrix A), not on any earlier state.
Solution. From the matrix Aand the 2004 state we can compute the 2009 state,
# # #

R 0.1 25(cid:3) 0 20(cid:3)0.8 55 0.1 0 0.8 55 46.5
To explain: The 2009 fDigure for C equals 25%times thTe prDobability 0.7 thatT CD goeTs intDo C, pTlus 20%times the
probability 0.1 that I goes into C, plus 55%times the probability 0 that R goes into C. Together,

Similarly, the new R is 46.5%. We see that the 2009 state vector is the column vector

where the column vector x(cid:2) 25 20 55 Tis the given 2004 state vector. Note that the sum of the entries of

Answer. In 2009 the commercial area will be 19.5% (11.7 mi2), the industrial 34% (20.4 mi2), and the
residential 46.5% (27.9 mi2). For 2014 the corresponding figures are 17.05%, 43.80%,and 39.15%. For 2019
they are 16.315%, 50.660%,and 33.025%. (In Sec. 8.2 we shall see what happens in the limit, assuming that

Linear Systems of Equations.
Gauss Elimination
We now come to one of the most important use of matrices, that is, using matrices to
solve systems of linear equations. We showed informally, in Example 1 of Sec. 7.1, how
to represent the information contained in a system of linear equations by a matrix, called
the augmented matrix. This matrix will then be used in solving the linear system of
equations. Our approach to solving linear systems is called the Gauss elimination method.
Since this method is so fundamental to linear algebra, the student should be alert.
A shorter term for systems of linear equations is just linear systems. Linear systems
model many applications in engineering, economics, statistics, and many other areas.
Electrical networks, traffic flow, and commodity markets may serve as specific examples
of applications.

1 2 1 2
three possible cases (see Fig. 158 on next page):
(a) Precisely one solution if the lines intersect
(b) Infinitely many solutions if the lines coincide
(c) No solution if the lines are parallel

If the system is homogenous, Case (c) cannot happen, because then those two straight lines pass through the
origin, whose coordinates (0, 0)constitute the trivial solution. Similarly, our present discussion can be extended
from two equations in two unknowns to three equations in three unknowns. We give the geometric interpretation
of three possible cases concerning solutions in Fig. 158. Instead of straight lines we have planes and the solution
depends on the positioning of these planes in space relative to each other. The student may wish to come up

many solutions
Our simple example illustrated that a system (1) may have no solution. This leads to such
questions as: Does a given system (1) have a solution? Under what conditions does it have
precisely one solution? If it has more than one solution, how can we characterize the set
of all solutions? We shall consider such questions in Sec. 7.5.
First, however, let us discuss an important systematic method for solving linear systems.
Gauss Elimination and Back Substitution
The Gauss elimination method can be motivated as follows. Consider a linear system that
is in triangular form (in full, upper triangular form) such as
2x (cid:3)5x (cid:2) 2
1 2
13x (cid:2)(cid:4)26
2
(Triangular means that all the nonzero entries of the corresponding coefficient matrix lie
above the diagonal and form an upside-down 90° triangle.) Then we can solve the system
by back substitution, that is, we solve the last equation for the variable, x (cid:2)(cid:4)26 13(cid:2)(cid:4)2,
2 >
No solution and then work backward, substituting x (cid:2)(cid:4)2into the first equation and solving it for x ,

1 2
We leave the first equation as it is. We eliminate x from the second equation, to get a
1
triangular system. For this we add twice the first equation to the second, and we do the same

where Row 2(cid:3)2 Row 1means “Add twice Row 1 to Row 2”in the original matrix. This
is the Gauss elimination(for 2 equations in 2 unknowns) giving the triangular form, from
which back substitution now yields x (cid:2)(cid:4)2 and x (cid:2)6, as before.
2 1
Since a linear system is completely determined by its augmented matrix, Gauss
elimination can be done by merely considering the matrices, as we have just indicated.
We do this again in the next example, emphasizing the matrices by writing them first and
the equations behind them, just as a help in order not to lose track.

Derivation from the circuit in Fig. 159 (Optional). This is the system for the unknown currents

choosing directions arbitrarily; if a current will come out negative, this will simply mean that the current flows
against the direction of our arrow. The current entering each battery will be the same as the current leaving it.
The equations for the currents result from Kirchhoff’s laws:
Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL).At any point of a circuit, the sum of the inflowing currents equals the sum
of the outflowing currents.
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL). In any closed loop, the sum of all voltage drops equals the impressed
electromotive force.

indicated in the figure.

Solution by Gauss Elimination. This system could be solved rather quickly by noticing its particular
form. But this is not the point. The point is that the Gauss elimination is systematic and will work in general,

augmented matrix of the system first and then the system itself:

Call the first row of A the pivot row and the first equation the pivot equation. Call the coefficient 1 of its

Add 1 times the pivot equation to the second equation.
Add (cid:3)20times the pivot equation to the fourth equation.
This corresponds to row operationson the augmented matrix as indicated in BLUEbehind the new matrixin

since it has no x-term (in fact, it is 0(cid:2)0), we must first change the order of the equations and the corresponding
2
rows of the new matrix. We put 0(cid:2)0at the end and move the third equation and the fourth equation one place
up. This is called partial pivoting (as opposed to the rarely used total pivoting, in which the order of the
unknowns is also changed). It gives

SEC. 7.3 Linear Systems of Equations. Gauss Elimination 277
Elementary Row Operations. Row-Equivalent Systems
Example 2 illustrates the operations of the Gauss elimination. These are the first two of
three operations, which are called
Elementary Row Operations for Matrices:
Interchange of two rows
Addition of a constant multiple of one row to another row
Multiplication of a row by a nonzero constant c
CAUTION! These operations are for rows, not for columns! They correspond to the
following
Elementary Operations for Equations:
Interchange of two equations
Addition of a constant multiple of one equation to another equation
Multiplication of an equation by a nonzero constant c
Clearly, the interchange of two equations does not alter the solution set. Neither does their
addition because we can undo it by a corresponding subtraction. Similarly for their
multiplication, which we can undo by multiplying the new equation by 1 c(since c(cid:6)0),
>
producing the original equation.
We now call a linear system S row-equivalent to a linear system S if S can be
1 2 1
obtained from S by (finitely many!) row operations. This justifies Gauss elimination and
2
establishes the following result.
THEOREM 1 Row-Equivalent Systems
Row-equivalent linear systems have the same set of solutions.
Because of this theorem, systems having the same solution sets are often called
equivalent systems. But note well that we are dealing with row operations. No column
operations on the augmented matrix are permitted in this context because they would
generally alter the solution set.
A linear system (1) is called overdeterminedif it has more equations than unknowns,
as in Example 2, determinedif m(cid:2)n, as in Example 1, and underdeterminedif it has
fewer equations than unknowns.
Furthermore, a system (1) is called consistent if it has at least one solution (thus, one
solution or infinitely many solutions), but inconsistent if it has no solutions at all, as
x (cid:3)x (cid:2)1, x (cid:3)x (cid:2)0 in Example 1, Case (c).

Gauss Elimination: The Three Possible
Cases of Systems
We have seen, in Example 2, that Gauss elimination can solve linear systems that have a
unique solution. This leaves us to apply Gauss elimination to a system with infinitely
many solutions (in Example 3) and one with no solution (in Example 4).

What will happen if we apply the Gauss elimination to a linear system that has no solution? The answer is that

Row Echelon Form and Information From It
At the end of the Gauss elimination the form of the coefficient matrix, the augmented
matrix, and the system itself are called the row echelon form. In it, rows of zeros, if
present, are the last rows, and, in each nonzero row, the leftmost nonzero entry is farther
to the right than in the previous row. For instance, in Example 4 the coefficient matrix
and its augmented in row echelon form are
3 2 1 3 2 1 | 3
|
(8) 0 (cid:4)1 1 and 0 (cid:4)1 1 | (cid:4)2 .
3 3 3 3 |
|
0 0 0 0 0 0 | 12
Note that we do noDt require thaTt the leftmost nDonzero entries be 1 sTince this would have
no theoretic or numeric advantage. (The so-called reduced echelon form, in which those
entries are 1, will be discussed in Sec. 7.8.)
The original system of m equations in nunknowns has augmented matrix A|b . This
3 4
is to be row reduced to matrix R|f . The two systems Ax (cid:2)band Rx(cid:2)fare equivalent:
3 4
if either one has a solution, so does the other, and the solutions are identical.

The number of nonzero rows, r, in the row-reduced coefficient matrix R is called the
rank of R and also the rank of A. Here is the method for determining whether Ax(cid:2)b
has solutions and what they are:
(a) No solution. If r is less than m (meaning that R actually has at least one row of
Á
all 0s) and at least one of the numbers f , f , , f is not zero, then the system
r(cid:3)1 r(cid:3)2 m
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 280
280 CHAP. 7 Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems
Rx (cid:2)f is inconsistent: No solution is possible. Therefore the system Ax (cid:2)b is
inconsistent as well. See Example 4, where r(cid:2)2(cid:9)m(cid:2)3 and f (cid:2)f (cid:2)12.

If the system is consistent (either r(cid:2)m,or r(cid:9)mandall the numbers f , f ,Á , f
r(cid:3)1 r(cid:3)2 m
are zero), then there are solutions.
(b) Unique solution. If the system is consistent and r(cid:2)n, there is exactly one
solution, which can be found by back substitution. See Example 2, where r(cid:2)n(cid:2)3
and m(cid:2)4.
(c) Infinitely many solutions. To obtain any of these solutions, choose values of

arbitrary values), then the (r (cid:4)1)st equation for x , and so on up the line. See

Orientation. Gauss elimination is reasonable in computing time and storage demand.
We shall consider those aspects in Sec. 20.1 in the chapter on numeric linear algebra.
Section 7.4 develops fundamental concepts of linear algebra such as linear independence
and rank of a matrix. These in turn will be used in Sec. 7.5 to fully characterize the
behavior of linear systems in terms of existence and uniqueness of solutions.

Linear Independence. Rank of a Matrix.
Vector Space
Since our next goal is to fully characterize the behavior of linear systems in terms
of existence and uniqueness of solutions (Sec. 7.5), we have to introduce new
fundamental linear algebraic concepts that will aid us in doing so. Foremost among
these are linear independence and the rank of a matrix. Keep in mind that these
concepts are intimately linked with the important Gauss elimination method and how
it works.
Linear Independence and Dependence of Vectors
Á
Given any set of mvectors a , , a (with the same number of components), a linear
(1) (m)
combination of these vectors is an expression of the form
c a (cid:3)c a (cid:3) Á (cid:3)c a
1 (1) 2 (2) m (m)
Á
where c , c , , c are any scalars. Now consider the equation
1 2 m
(1) c a (cid:3)c a (cid:3) Á (cid:3)c a (cid:2)0.
1 (1) 2 (2) m (m)
Clearly, this vector equation (1) holds if we choose all c’s zero, because then it becomes
j
0(cid:2)0. If this is the only m-tuple of scalars for which (1) holds, then our vectors
Á
a , , a are said to form a linearly independent set or, more briefly, we call them
(1) (m)
linearly independent. Otherwise, if (1) also holds with scalars not all zero, we call these
vectors linearly dependent. This means that we can express at least one of the vectors
as a linear combination of the other vectors. For instance, if (1) holds with, say,
c (cid:6)0, we can solve (1) for a :
1 (1)
a (cid:2)k a (cid:3) Á (cid:3)k a where k (cid:2)(cid:4)c c .
(1) 2 (2) m (m) j j> 1
(Some k ’s may be zero. Or even all of them, namely, if a (cid:2)0.)
j (1)
Why is linear independence important? Well, if a set of vectors is linearly
dependent, then we can get rid of at least one or perhaps more of the vectors until we
get a linearly independent set. This set is then the smallest “truly essential” set with
which we can work. Thus, we cannot express any of the vectors, of this set, linearly
in terms of the others.

Rank of a Matrix
DEFINITION The rankof a matrix Ais the maximum number of linearly independent row vectors
of A. It is denoted by rank A.
Our further discussion will show that the rank of a matrix is an important key concept for
understanding general properties of matrices and linear systems of equations.

Note further that rank A(cid:2)0if and only if A(cid:2)0.This follows directly from the definition. (cid:2)
We call a matrix A row-equivalent to a matrix A if A can be obtained from A by
1 2 1 2
(finitely many!) elementary row operations.
Now the maximum number of linearly independent row vectors of a matrix does not
change if we change the order of rows or multiply a row by a nonzero c or take a linear
combination by adding a multiple of a row to another row. This shows that rank is
invariant under elementary row operations:
THEOREM 1 Row-Equivalent Matrices
Row-equivalent matrices have the same rank.
Hence we can determine the rank of a matrix by reducing the matrix to row-echelon
form, as was done in Sec. 7.3. Once the matrix is in row-echelon form, we count the
number of nonzero rows, which is precisely the rank of the matrix.

Examples 1–3 illustrate the following useful theorem (with p(cid:2)3,n(cid:2)3,and the rank of
the matrix (cid:2)2).
THEOREM 2 Linear Independence and Dependence of Vectors
Consider p vectors that each have n components. Then these vectors are linearly
independent if the matrix formed, with these vectors as row vectors, has rank p.
However, these vectors are linearly dependent if that matrix has rank less than p.
Further important properties will result from the basic
THEOREM 3 Rank in Terms of Column Vectors
The rank r of a matrix A equals the maximum number of linearly independent
column vectors of A.
Hence A and its transpose AT have the same rank.
PROOF In this proof we write simply “rows” and “columns” for row and column vectors. Let A
be an m(cid:5)nmatrix of rank A(cid:2)r.Then by definition of rank, Ahas rlinearly independent

of A. We see that
each of these ncolumns is a linear combination of the same rcolumns on the right. Hence
Acannot have more linearly independent columns than rows, whose number is rank A(cid:2)r.
Now rows of Aare columns of the transpose AT. For ATour conclusion is that ATcannot
have more linearly independent columns than rows, so that A cannot have more linearly
independent rows than columns. Together, the number of linearly independent columns
of A must be r, the rank of A. This completes the proof. (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 4 Illustration of Theorem 3
The matrix in (2) has rank 2. From Example 3 we see that the first two row vectors are linearly independent
and by “working backward” we can verify that Row 3(cid:2)6 Row 1(cid:4)1Row 2.Similarly, the first two columns
2
are linearly independent, and by reducing the last matrix in Example 3 by columns we find that

Combining Theorems 2 and 3 we obtain
THEOREM 4 Linear Dependence of Vectors
Consider p vectors each having n components. If n(cid:9)p, then these vectors are
linearly dependent.
PROOF The matrix Awith those pvectors as row vectors has prows and n(cid:9)p columns; hence
by Theorem 3 it has rank A(cid:8)n(cid:9)p,which implies linear dependence by Theorem 2. (cid:2)
Vector Space
The following related concepts are of general interest in linear algebra. In the present
context they provide a clarification of essential properties of matrices and their role in
connection with linear systems.
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 286
286 CHAP. 7 Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems
Consider a nonempty set V of vectors where each vector has the same number of
components.If, for any two vectors aand bin V,we have that all their linear combinations
aa(cid:3)bb (a, bany real numbers) are also elements of V, and if, furthermore, a and b satisfy
the laws (3a), (3c), (3d), and (4) in Sec. 7.1, as well as any vectors a,b,cin Vsatisfy (3b)
then Vis a vector space. Note that here we wrote laws (3) and (4) of Sec.7.1 in lowercase
letters a, b, c, which is our notation for vectors. More on vector spaces in Sec. 7.9.
The maximum number of linearly independent vectors in Vis called the dimensionof
Vand is denoted by dim V. Here we assume the dimension to be finite; infinite dimension
will be defined in Sec. 7.9.
A linearly independent set in V consisting of a maximum possible number of vectors
in Vis called a basisfor V. In other words, any largest possible set of independent vectors
in V forms basis for V. That means, if we add one or more vector to that set, the set will
be linearly dependent. (See also the beginning of Sec. 7.4 on linear independence and
dependence of vectors.) Thus, the number of vectors of a basis for V equals dim V.
Á
The set of all linear combinations of given vectors a , , a with the same number
(1) (p)
of components is called the spanof these vectors. Obviously, a span is a vector space. If
Á
in addition, the given vectors a , , a are linearly independent, then they form a basis
(1) (p)
for that vector space.
This then leads to another equivalent definition of basis. A set of vectors is a basis for
a vector space Vif (1) the vectors in the set are linearly independent, and if (2) any vector
in V can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in the set. If (2) holds, we
also say that the set of vectors spans the vector space V.
By a subspaceof a vector space Vwe mean a nonempty subset of V(including Vitself)
that forms a vector space with respect to the two algebraic operations (addition and scalar
multiplication) defined for the vectors of V.
EXAMPLE 5 Vector Space, Dimension, Basis
The span of the three vectors in Example 1 is a vector space of dimension 2. A basis of this vector space consists
(cid:2)
of any two of those three vectors, for instance, a , a ,or a , a ,etc.
(1) (2) (1) (3)
We further note the simple
THEOREM 5 Vector Space Rn
The vector space Rn consisting of all vectors with n components (n real numbers)
has dimension n.
PROOF A basis of n vectors is a (cid:2) 1 0 Á 0 , a (cid:2) 0 1 0 Á 0 , Á ,
a (cid:2) 0 Á 0 1 . (1) 3 4 (2) 3 4 (cid:2)
(n) 3 4
For a matrix A, we call the span of the row vectors the row space of A. Similarly, the
span of the column vectors of A is called the column space of A.
Now, Theorem 3 shows that a matrix A has as many linearly independent rows as
columns. By the definition of dimension, their number is the dimension of the row space
or the column space of A. This proves
THEOREM 6 Row Space and Column Space
The row space and the column space of a matrixAhave the same dimension, equal
to rank A.

vector space, called the null space of A, and its dimension is called the nullity of A. In

Solutions of Linear Systems:
Existence, Uniqueness
Rank, as just defined, gives complete information about existence, uniqueness, and general
structure of the solution set of linear systems as follows.
A linear system of equations in n unknowns has a unique solution if the coefficient
matrix and the augmented matrix have the same rank n, and infinitely many solutions if
that common rank is less than n. The system has no solution if those two matrices have
different rank.
To state this precisely and prove it, we shall use the generally important concept of a
submatrixof A. By this we mean any matrix obtained from Aby omitting some rows or
columns (or both). By definition this includes Aitself (as the matrix obtained by omitting
no rows or columns); this is practical.

SEC. 7.5 Solutions of Linear Systems: Existence, Uniqueness 289
(c) Infinitely many solutions. If this common rank r is less than n, the system
(1) has infinitely many solutions. All of these solutions are obtained by determining
r suitable unknowns(whose submatrix of coefficients must have rank r) in terms of
the remaining n(cid:4)r unknowns, to which arbitrary values can be assigned. (See
Example 3 in Sec. 7.3.)
(d) Gauss elimination (Sec. 7.3). If solutions exist, they can all be obtained by
the Gauss elimination. (This method will automatically reveal whether or not
solutions exist; see Sec. 7.3.)

A is obtained by augmenting A by a single column b. Hence, by Theorem 3 in Sec. 7.4,
(cid:2)
rank A equals rank A or rank A(cid:3)1. Now if (1) has a solution x, then (2) shows that b
(cid:2)
must be a linear combination of those column vectors, so that A and A have the same
maximum number of linearly independent column vectors and thus the same rank.
(cid:2)
Conversely, if rank A (cid:2) rank A, then b must be a linear combination of the column
vectors of A, say,
(2*) b(cid:2)a c (cid:3) Á (cid:3)a c
1 (1) n (n)
(cid:2)
since otherwise rank A (cid:2)rank A(cid:3)1. But (2*) means that (1) has a solution, namely,
x (cid:2)a ,Á , x (cid:2)a , as can be seen by comparing (2*) and (2).
1 1 n n
(b) If rank A(cid:2)n,the n column vectors in (2) are linearly independent by Theorem 3
in Sec. 7.4. We claim that then the representation (2) of b is unique because otherwise

1 1 (1) n n (n)
and x (cid:4)(cid:2) x (cid:2)0,Á , x (cid:4)(cid:2) x (cid:2)0by linear independence. But this means that the scalars

x , , x in (2) are uniquely determined, that is, the solution of (1) is unique.

(c) If rank A(cid:2)rank A (cid:2)r(cid:9)n, then by Theorem 3 in Sec. 7.4 there is a linearly
independent set K of r column vectors of A such that the other n(cid:4)r column vectors of
A are linear combinations of those vectors. We renumber the columns and unknowns,
Á
denoting the renumbered quantities byˆ, so that {cˆ , , cˆ }is that linearly independent

(d) This was discussed in Sec. 7.3 and is restated here as a reminder. (cid:2)
The theorem is illustrated in Sec. 7.3. In Example 2 there is a unique solution since rank
(cid:2)
A (cid:2)rank A (cid:2)n(cid:2)3 (as can be seen from the last matrix in the example). In Example 3
(cid:2)
we have rank A (cid:2)rank A (cid:2)2(cid:9)n(cid:2)4 and can choose x and x arbitrarily. In
(cid:2) 3 4
Example 4 there is no solution because rank A(cid:2)2(cid:9)rank A (cid:2)3.
Homogeneous Linear System
Recall from Sec. 7.3 that a linear system (1) is called homogeneous if all the b’s are
j
zero, and nonhomogeneous if one or several b’s are not zero. For the homogeneous
j
system we obtain from the Fundamental Theorem the following results.

1 n
only if rankA (cid:9)n.Ifrank A(cid:2)r(cid:9)n,these solutions, together withx(cid:2)0,form a
vector space (see Sec. 7.4) of dimension n(cid:4)r called the solution spaceof (4).
In particular, if x and x are solution vectors of (4), then x(cid:2)c x (cid:3)c x
(1) (2) 1 (1) 2 (2)
with any scalars c and c is a solution vector of (4). (This does not hold for
1 2
nonhomogeneous systems. Also, the term solution space is used for homogeneous
systems only.)
PROOF The first proposition can be seen directly from the system. It agrees with the fact that
(cid:2)
b(cid:2)0implies that rank A (cid:2)rank A, so that a homogeneous system is always consistent.
If rank A(cid:2)n, the trivial solution is the unique solution according to (b) in Theorem 1.
If rank A(cid:9)n,there are nontrivial solutions according to (c) in Theorem 1. The solutions
form a vector space because if x and x are any of them, then Ax (cid:2)0, Ax (cid:2)0,
(1) (2) (1) (2)
and this implies A(x (cid:3)x )(cid:2)Ax (cid:3)Ax (cid:2)0 as well as A(cx )(cid:2)cAx (cid:2)0,

Á
suitable unknowns,call them x , , x , in an arbitrary fashion, and every solution is
r(cid:3)1 n
obtained in this way. Hence a basis for the solution space, briefly called a basis of
Á
solutions of (4), is y , , y , where the basis vector y is obtained by choosing
(1) (n(cid:2)r) (j)
x (cid:2)1 and the other x ,Á , x zero; the corresponding first r components of this
r(cid:3)j r(cid:3)1 n
solution vector are then determined. Thus the solution space of (4) has dimension n(cid:4)r.
This proves Theorem 2. (cid:2)
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 291
SEC. 7.6 For Reference: Second- and Third-Order Determinants 291
The solution space of (4) is also called the null space of A because Ax (cid:2)0 for every x in
the solution space of (4). Its dimension is called the nullityof A. Hence Theorem 2 states that
(5) rank A (cid:3)nullity A(cid:2)n
where n is the number of unknowns (number of columns of A).
Furthermore, by the definition of rank we have rank A(cid:8)m in (4). Hence if m(cid:9)n,
then rank A(cid:9)n. By Theorem 2 this gives the practically important
Homogeneous Linear System with Fewer Equations Than Unknowns
THEOREM 3
A homogeneous linear system with fewer equations than unknowns always has
nontrivial solutions.
Nonhomogeneous Linear Systems
The characterization of all solutions of the linear system (1) is now quite simple, as follows.
THEOREM 4 Nonhomogeneous Linear System
If a nonhomogeneous linear system (1) is consistent, then all of its solutions are
obtained as
(6) x(cid:2)x (cid:3)x
0 h
where x is any (fixed) solution of (1) and x runs through all the solutions of the
0 h
corresponding homogeneous system (4).
PROOF The difference x (cid:2)x(cid:4)x of any two solutions of (1) is a solution of (4) because
h 0
Ax (cid:2)A(x(cid:4)x )(cid:2)Ax(cid:4)Ax (cid:2)b(cid:4)b(cid:2)0. Since x is any solution of (1), we get all
h 0 0
the solutions of (1) if in (6) we take any solution x of (1) and let x vary throughout the
0 h
solution space of (4). (cid:2)
This covers a main part of our discussion of characterizing the solutions of systems of
linear equations. Our next main topic is determinants and their role in linear equations.

Determinants. Cramer’s Rule
Determinants were originally introduced for solving linear systems. Although impractical
in computations, they have important engineering applications in eigenvalue problems
(Sec. 8.1), differential equations, vector algebra (Sec. 9.3), and in other areas. They can
be introduced in several equivalent ways. Our definition is particularly for dealing with
linear systems.

In this way, Dis defined in terms of ndeterminants of order n(cid:4)1, each of which is,
in turn, defined in terms of n(cid:4)1 determinants of order n(cid:4)2, and so on—until we
finally arrive at second-order determinants, in which those submatrices consist of single
entries whose determinant is defined to be the entry itself.
From the definition it follows that we mayexpandD by any row or column, that is, choose
in (3) the entries in any row or column, similarly when expanding the C ’s in (3), and so on.

This definition is unambiguous, that is, it yields the same value for Dno matter which
columns or rows we choose in expanding. A proof is given in App. 4.

General Properties of Determinants
There is an attractive way of finding determinants (1) that consists of applying elementary
row operations to (1). By doing so we obtain an “upper triangular” determinant (see
Sec.7.1, for definition with “matrix” replaced by “determinant”) whose value is then very
easy to compute, being just the product of its diagonal entries. This approach is similar
(but not the same!) to what we did to matrices in Sec. 7.3. In particular, be aware that
interchanging two rows in a determinant introduces a multiplicative factor of (cid:4)1 to the
value of the determinant! Details are as follows.
THEOREM 1 Behavior of an nth-Order Determinant under Elementary Row Operations
(a) Interchange of two rows multiplies the value of the determinant by (cid:4)1.
(b) Addition of a multiple of a row to another row does not alter the value of the
determinant.
(c) Multiplication of a row by a nonzero constant c multiplies the value of the
determinant by c. (This holds also when c(cid:2)0, but no longer gives an elementary
row operation.)
PROOF (a) By induction. The statement holds for n(cid:2)2 because
a b c d
(cid:2)ad(cid:4)bc, but (cid:2)bc(cid:4)ad.
c d a b

296 CHAP. 7 Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems
We now make the induction hypothesis that (a) holds for determinants of order n(cid:4)1 (cid:10) 2
and show that it then holds for determinants of order n. Let D be of order n. Let E be
obtained from D by the interchange of two rows. Expand D and E by a row that is not
one of those interchanged, call it the jth row. Then by (4a),
n n
(5) D(cid:2) a((cid:4)1) j(cid:3)ka jkM jk, E(cid:2) a((cid:4)1) j(cid:3)ka jkN
jk
k(cid:2)1 k(cid:2)1
where N is obtained from the minor M of a in D by the interchange of those two
jk jk jk
rows which have been interchanged in D (and which N must both contain because we
jk
expand by another row!). Now these minors are of order n(cid:4)1. Hence the induction
hypothesis applies and gives N (cid:2)(cid:4)M . Thus E(cid:2)(cid:4)D by (5).
jk jk(cid:2)
(b) Add c times Row i to Row j. Let D be the new determinant. Its entries in Row j
(cid:2)
are a (cid:3)ca . If we expand D by this Row j, we see that we can write it as
(cid:2) jk ik
D (cid:2)D (cid:3)cD , where D (cid:2)D has in Row j the a , whereas D has in that Row j the
1 2 1 jk 2
a from the addition. Hence D has a in both Row i and Row j. Interchanging these
jk 2 jk
two rows gives D back, but on the other hand it gives (cid:4)D by (a). Together
2 (cid:2) 2
D (cid:2)(cid:4)D (cid:2)0, so that D (cid:2)D (cid:2)D.

(c) Expand the determinant by the row that has been multiplied.

THEOREM 2 Further Properties of nth-Order Determinants
(a)–(c) in Theorem 1 hold also for columns.
(d) Transposition leaves the value of a determinant unaltered.
(e) A zero row or column renders the value of a determinant zero.
(f) Proportional rows or columns render the value of a determinant zero. In
particular, a determinant with two identical rows or columns has the value zero.
PROOF (a)–(e) follow directly from the fact that a determinant can be expanded by any row
column. In (d), transposition is defined as for matrices, that is, the jth row becomes the
jth column of the transpose.
(f) If Row j(cid:2)c times Row i, then D(cid:2)cD , where D has Row j(cid:2)Row i. Hence
1 1
an interchange of these rows reproduces D , but it also gives (cid:4)D by Theorem 1(a).
1 1
Hence D (cid:2)0 and D(cid:2)cD (cid:2)0. Similarly for columns. (cid:2)
1 1
It is quite remarkable that the important concept of the rank of a matrix A, which is the
maximum number of linearly independent row or column vectors of A(see Sec. 7.4), can
be related to determinants. Here we may assume that rank A(cid:11)0because the only matrices
with rank 0 are the zero matrices (see Sec. 7.4).
THEOREM 3 Rank in Terms of Determinants
Consider an m(cid:5)n matrix A(cid:2) a :
3 jk4
(1) A has rank r (cid:10) 1 if and only if A has an r(cid:5)r submatrix with a nonzero
determinant.
(2) The determinant of any square submatrix with more than r rows, contained
in A (if such a matrix exists!) has a value equal to zero.
Furthermore, if m(cid:2)n, we have:
(3) An n(cid:5)n square matrix A has rank n if and only if
det A (cid:6)0.
PROOF The key idea is that elementary row operations (Sec. 7.3) alter neither rank (by Theorem
1 in Sec. 7.4) nor the property of a determinant being nonzero (by Theorem 1 in this
section). The echelon form Â of A (see Sec. 7.3) has r nonzero row vectors (which are
the first r row vectors) if and only if rank A(cid:2)r. Without loss of generality, we can
assume that r (cid:10) 1. Let Rˆ be the r(cid:5)r submatrix in the left upper corner of Â (so that
the entries of Rˆ are in both the first r rows and r columns of Â). Now Rˆ is triangular,
with all diagonal entries r nonzero. Thus, det Rˆ (cid:2)r Á r (cid:6)0.Also det R(cid:6)0 for
jj 11 rr
the corresponding r(cid:5)r submatrix R of A because Rˆ results from R by elementary row
operations. This proves part (1).
Similarly, det S (cid:2)0 for any square submatrix S of r(cid:3)1 or more rows perhaps
contained in A because the corresponding submatrix Sˆ of Â must contain a row of zeros
(otherwise we would have rank A (cid:10) r(cid:3)1), so that det Sˆ (cid:2)0 by Theorem 2. This proves
part (2). Furthermore, we have proven the theorem for an m(cid:5)n matrix.
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 298
298 CHAP. 7 Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems
For an n(cid:5)n square matrix A we proceed as follows. To prove (3), we apply part (1)
(already proven!). This gives us that rank A(cid:2)n (cid:10) 1if and only if Acontains an n(cid:5)n
submatrix with nonzero determinant. But the only such submatrix contained in our square
matrix A, is A itself, hence det A (cid:6)0. This proves part (3). (cid:2)
Cramer’s Rule
Theorem 3 opens the way to the classical solution formula for linear systems known as
Cramer’s rule,2which gives solutions as quotients of determinants. Cramer’s rule is not
practical in computationsfor which the methods in Secs. 7.3 and 20.1–20.3 are suitable.
However, Cramer’s rule is of theoretical interestin differential equations (Secs. 2.10 and
3.3) and in other theoretical work that has engineering applications.

~
then rank A(cid:2)n by Theorem 3. Thus rank A(cid:2)rank A. Hence, by the Fundamental
Theorem in Sec. 7.5, the system (6) has a unique solution.
Let us now prove (7). Expanding D by its kth column, we obtain
(9) D(cid:2)a C (cid:3)a C (cid:3) Á (cid:3)a C ,
1k 1k 2k 2k nk nk
where C is the cofactor of entry a in D. If we replace the entries in the kth column of
ik ik
D by any other numbers, we obtain a new determinant, say, Dˆ. Clearly, its expansion by
Á
the kth column will be of the form (9), with a , , a replaced by those new numbers
1k nk
and the cofactors C as before. In particular, if we choose as new numbers the entries
ik
a ,Á , a of the lth column of D (where l(cid:6)k), we have a new determinant Dˆ which
1l nl
has the column a Á a Ttwice, once as its lth column, and once as its kth because
of the replacem3 en1 tl . Hence Dˆn (cid:2)l4 0 by Theorem 2(f). If we now expand Dˆ by the column
that has been replaced (the kth column), we thus obtain
(10) a C (cid:3)a C (cid:3) Á (cid:3)a C (cid:2)0 (l(cid:6)k).
1l 1k 2l 2k nl nk
Á
We now multiply the first equation in (6) by C on both sides, the second by C , ,
1k 2k
the last by C , and add the resulting equations. This gives
nk
C (a x (cid:3)Á (cid:3)a x )(cid:3)Á(cid:3)C (a x (cid:3) Á (cid:3)a x )

Collecting terms with the same x, we can write the left side as
j
x (a C (cid:3)a C (cid:3)Á(cid:3)a C )(cid:3)Á(cid:3)x (a C (cid:3)a C (cid:3)Á(cid:3)a C ).
1 11 1k 21 2k n1 nk n 1n 1k 2n 2k nn nk
From this we see that x is multiplied by
k
a C (cid:3)a C (cid:3) Á (cid:3)a C .
1k 1k 2k 2k nk nk
Equation (9) shows that this equals D. Similarly, x is multiplied by
1
a C (cid:3)a C (cid:3) Á (cid:3)a C .
1l 1k 2l 2k nl nk
Equation (10) shows that this is zero when l(cid:6)k.Accordingly, the left side of (11) equals
simply x D, so that (11) becomes
k

Now the right side of this is D as defined in the theorem, expanded by its kth column,

Inverse of a Matrix.
Gauss–Jordan Elimination
In this section we consider square matrices exclusively.
The inverse of an n(cid:5)n matrix A(cid:2) a is denoted by A(cid:2)1 and is an n(cid:5)n matrix
3 jk4
such that
(1)
AA(cid:2)1(cid:2)A(cid:2)1A(cid:2)I
where I is the n(cid:5)n unit matrix (see Sec. 7.2).
If A has an inverse, then A is called a nonsingular matrix. If A has no inverse, then
A is called a singular matrix.
If A has an inverse, the inverse is unique.
Indeed, if both Band Care inverses of A,then AB(cid:2)Iand CA (cid:2)I, so that we obtain
the uniqueness from
B(cid:2)IB(cid:2)(CA)B(cid:2)C(AB)(cid:2)CI (cid:2)C.
We prove next that A has an inverse (is nonsingular) if and only if it has maximum
possible rank n. The proof will also show that Ax (cid:2)b implies x(cid:2)A(cid:2)1b provided A(cid:2)1
exists, and will thus give a motivation for the inverse as well as a relation to linear systems.
(But this will notgive a good method of solving Ax (cid:2)bnumericallybecause the Gauss
elimination in Sec. 7.3 requires fewer computations.)
THEOREM 1 Existence of the Inverse
The inverse A(cid:2)1 of an n(cid:5)n matrix A exists if and only if rank A (cid:2)n, thus (by
Theorem 3, Sec. 7.7) if and only ifdet A (cid:6)0. HenceAis nonsingular ifrank A (cid:2)n,
and is singular if rank A (cid:9)n.
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 302
302 CHAP. 7 Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems
PROOF Let A be a given n(cid:5)n matrix and consider the linear system
(2) Ax (cid:2)b.
If the inverse
A(cid:2)1
exists, then multiplication from the left on both sides and use of (1)
gives
A(cid:2)1Ax (cid:2)x(cid:2)A(cid:2)1b.
This shows that (2) has a solution x,which is unique because, for another solution u,we
have Au (cid:2)b, so that u(cid:2)A(cid:2)1b(cid:2)x. Hence A must have rank n by the Fundamental
Theorem in Sec. 7.5.
Conversely, let rank A(cid:2)n. Then by the same theorem, the system (2) has a unique
solution xfor any b. Now the back substitution following the Gauss elimination (Sec. 7.3)
shows that the components x of x are linear combinations of those of b. Hence we can
j
write
(3) x(cid:2)Bb
with B to be determined. Substitution into (2) gives
Ax (cid:2)A(Bb)(cid:2)(AB)b(cid:2)Cb (cid:2)b (C (cid:2)AB)
for any b. Hence C(cid:2)AB (cid:2)I,the unit matrix. Similarly, if we substitute (2) into (3) we get
x(cid:2)Bb(cid:2)B(Ax)(cid:2)(BA)x
for any x (and b(cid:2)Ax). Hence BA(cid:2)I. Together, B(cid:2)A(cid:2)1 exists. (cid:2)
Determination of the Inverse by the
Gauss–Jordan Method
To actually determine the inverse A(cid:2)1 of a nonsingular n(cid:5)n matrix A, we can use a
variant of the Gauss elimination (Sec. 7.3), called the Gauss–Jordan elimination.3 The
idea of the method is as follows.
Using A, we form n linear systems
Ax (cid:2)e , Á , Ax (cid:2)e
(1) (1) (n) (n)
where the vectors e ,Á , e are the columns of the n(cid:5)n unit matrix I; thus,
(1) (n)
e (cid:2) 1 0 Á 0 T, e (cid:2) 0 1 0 Á 0 T, etc. These are nvector equations
(1) 3 4 (2) Á 3 4
in the unknown vectors x , , x . We combine them into a single matrix equation

in Africa, where he surveyed oases. [See Althoen, S.C. and R. McLaughlin, Gauss–Jordan reduction: A brief
history. American Mathematical Monthly,Vol. 94, No. 2 (1987), pp. 130–142.]
We do not recommendit as a method for solving systems of linear equations, since the number of operations
in addition to those of the Gauss elimination is larger than that for back substitution, which the Gauss–Jordan
elimination avoids. See also Sec. 20.1.

gives X(cid:2)A(cid:2)1I(cid:2)A(cid:2)1. 3 Hence4 , to solve AX (cid:2)I for X, we can apply the Gauss
(cid:2)
elimination to A(cid:2) A I . This gives a matrix of the form U H with upper triangular
3 4 3 4
U because the Gauss elimination triangularizes systems. The Gauss–Jordan method
reduces Uby further elementary row operations to diagonal form, in fact to the unit matrix
I. This is done by eliminating the entries of U above the main diagonal and making the
diagonal entries all 1 by multiplication (see Example 1). Of course, the method operates
on the entire matrix U H , transforming Hinto some matrix K,hence the entire U H
to I K . This is t3 he “aug4 mented matrix” of IX (cid:2)K. Now IX (cid:2)X(cid:2)A(cid:2)1, as3 shown4

Formulas for Inverses
Since finding the inverse of a matrix is really a problem of solving a system of linear
equations, it is not surprising that Cramer’s rule (Theorem 4, Sec. 7.7) might come into
play. And similarly, as Cramer’s rule was useful for theoretical study but not for
computation, so too is the explicit formula (4) in the following theorem useful for
theoretical considerations but not recommended for actually determining inverse matrices,
except for the frequently occurring 2(cid:5)2 case as given in (4*).

PROOF The idea is to start from (1) for AC instead of A, that is,
AC(AC)(cid:2)1(cid:2)I,
and multiply
it on both sides from the left, first by
A(cid:2)1,
which because of
A(cid:2)1A(cid:2)I
gives
A(cid:2)1AC(AC)(cid:2)1(cid:2)C(AC)(cid:2)1
(cid:2)A(cid:2)1I(cid:2)A(cid:2)1,
and then multiplying this on both sides from the left, this time by

C(cid:2)1C(AC)(cid:2)1(cid:2)(AC)(cid:2)1(cid:2)C(cid:2)1A(cid:2)1.
This proves (7), and from it, (8) follows by induction. (cid:2)
We also note that the inverse of the inverse is the given matrix, as you may prove,

Unusual Properties of Matrix Multiplication.
Cancellation Laws
Section 7.2 contains warnings that some properties of matrix multiplication deviate from
those for numbers, and we are now able to explain the restricted validity of the so-called
cancellation laws [2] and [3] below, using rank and inverse, concepts that were not yet
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 307
SEC. 7.8 Inverse of a Matrix. Gauss–Jordan Elimination 307
available in Sec. 7.2. The deviations from the usual are of great practical importance and
must be carefully observed. They are as follows.
[1] Matrix multiplication is not commutative, that is, in general we have
AB (cid:6)BA.
[2] AB (cid:2)0 does not generally imply A(cid:2)0 or B(cid:2)0 (or BA(cid:2)0); for example,
1 1 (cid:4)1 1 0 0
(cid:2) .
c

(cid:4)1d c

[3] AC(cid:2)AD does not generally imply C(cid:2)D (even when A(cid:6)0).
Complete answers to [2] and [3] are contained in the following theorem.
THEOREM 3 Cancellation Laws
Let A, B, C be n(cid:5)n matrices. Then:
(a) If rank A(cid:2)n and AB (cid:2)AC, then B(cid:2)C.
(b) If rank A(cid:2)n, then AB (cid:2)0 implies B(cid:2)0. Hence if AB(cid:2)0, but A(cid:6)0
as well as B(cid:6)0, then rank A(cid:9)n and rank B(cid:9)n.
(c) If A is singular, so are BA and AB.
PROOF (a) The inverse of A exists by Theorem 1. Multiplication by
A(cid:2)1
from the left gives
A(cid:2)1AB (cid:2)A(cid:2)1AC, hence B(cid:2)C.
(b)Let rank A(cid:2)n. Then A(cid:2)1exists, and AB (cid:2)0implies A(cid:2)1AB (cid:2)B(cid:2)0.Similarly
when rank B(cid:2)n. This implies the second statement in (b).
(c )Rank A(cid:9)nby Theorem 1. Hence Ax (cid:2)0has nontrivial solutions by Theorem 2
1
in Sec. 7.5. Multiplication by Bshows that these solutions are also solutions of BAx (cid:2)0,
so that rank (BA)(cid:9)n by Theorem 2 in Sec. 7.5 and BA is singular by Theorem 1.
(c ) AT is singular by Theorem 2(d) in Sec. 7.7. Hence BTAT is singular by part (c ),

and is equal to (AB)T by (10d) in Sec. 7.2. Hence AB is singular by Theorem 2(d) in
Sec. 7.7. (cid:2)
Determinants of Matrix Products
The determinant of a matrix product AB or BA can be written as the product of the
determinants of the factors, and it is interesting that det AB (cid:2)det BA,although AB (cid:6)BA
in general. The corresponding formula (10) is needed occasionally and can be obtained
by Gauss–Jordan elimination (see Example 1) and from the theorem just proved.
THEOREM 4 Determinant of a Product of Matrices
For any n(cid:5)n matrices A and B,
(10) det (AB)(cid:2)det (BA)(cid:2)det A det B.
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 308

PROOF If A or B is singular, so are AB and BA by Theorem 3(c), and (10) reduces to 0(cid:2)0 by
Theorem 3 in Sec. 7.7.
Now let Aand Bbe nonsingular. Then we can reduce Ato a diagonal matrix Â (cid:2)[a ]
jk
by Gauss–Jordan steps. Under these operations, det A retains its value, by Theorem 1 in
Sec. 7.7, (a) and (b) [not (c)] except perhaps for a sign reversal in row interchanging when
pivoting. But the same operations reduce AB to ÂB with the same effect on det (AB).
Hence it remains to prove (10) for ÂB; written out,

Vector Spaces, Inner Product Spaces,
Linear Transformations Optional
We have captured the essence of vector spaces in Sec. 7.4. There we dealt with special
vector spacesthat arose quite naturally in the context of matrices and linear systems. The
elements of these vector spaces, called vectors, satisfied rules (3) and (4) of Sec. 7.1
(which were similar to those for numbers). These special vector spaces were generated
by spans, that is, linear combination of finitely many vectors. Furthermore, each such
vector had n real numbers as components. Review this material before going on.
We can generalize this idea by taking all vectors with n real numbers as components
and obtain the very important real n-dimensional vector spaceRn. The vectors are known
as “real vectors.” Thus, each vector in Rn is an ordered n-tuple of real numbers.
Now we can consider special values for n. For n(cid:2)2, we obtain R2, the vector space
of all ordered pairs, which correspond to the vectors in the plane.For n(cid:2)3, we obtain
R3, the vector space of all ordered triples, which are the vectors in 3-space. These vectors
have wide applications in mechanics, geometry, and calculus and are basic to the engineer
and physicist.
Similarly, if we take all ordered n-tuples of complex numbers as vectors and complex
numbers as scalars, we obtain the complex vector spaceCn, which we shall consider in
Sec. 8.5.
Furthermore, there are other sets of practical interest consisting of matrices, functions,
transformations, or others for which addition and scalar multiplication can be defined in
an almost natural way so that they too form vector spaces.
It is perhaps not too great an intellectual jump to create, from the concrete model Rn,
the abstract concept of a real vector space V by taking the basic properties (3) and (4)
in Sec. 7.1 as axioms. In this way, the definition of a real vector space arises.
DEFINITION Real Vector Space
A nonempty set Vof elements a,b, •••is called a real vector space(or real linear
space), and these elements are called vectors(regardless of their nature, which will
come out from the context or will be left arbitrary) if, in V, there are defined two
algebraic operations (called vector addition and scalar multiplication) as follows.
I. Vector addition associates with every pair of vectors a and b of V a unique
vector of V, called the sumof aand band denoted by a(cid:3)b, such that the following
axioms are satisfied.
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 310
310 CHAP. 7 Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems
I.1 Commutativity. For any two vectors a and b of V,
a (cid:3) b (cid:2) b (cid:3) a.
I.2 Associativity. For any three vectors a, b, c of V,
(a (cid:3) b) (cid:3) c (cid:2) a (cid:3) (b (cid:3) c) (written a (cid:3) b (cid:3) c).
I.3 There is a unique vector in V, called the zero vector and denoted by 0, such
that for every a in V,
a (cid:3) 0 (cid:2) a.
I.4 For every a in V there is a unique vector in V that is denoted by (cid:4)a and is
such that
a (cid:3) ((cid:4)a) (cid:2) 0.
II. Scalar multiplication. The real numbers are called scalars. Scalar
multiplication associates with every ain Vand every scalar ca unique vector of V,
called the product of c and a and denoted by ca (or ac) such that the following
axioms are satisfied.
II.1 Distributivity. For every scalar c and vectors a and b in V,
c(a (cid:3) b) (cid:2) ca (cid:3) cb.
II.2 Distributivity. For all scalars c and k and every a in V,
(c (cid:3) k)a (cid:2) ca (cid:3) ka.
II.3 Associativity. For all scalars c and k and every a in V,
c(ka) (cid:2) (ck)a (written cka).
II.4 For every a in V,
1a (cid:2) a.
If, in the above definition, we take complex numbers as scalars instead of real numbers,
we obtain the axiomatic definition of a complex vector space.
Take a look at the axioms in the above definition. Each axiom stands on its own: It
is concise, useful, and it expresses a simple property of V. There are as few axioms as
possible and together they express all the desired properties of V.Selecting good axioms
is a process of trial and error that often extends over a long period of time. But once
agreed upon, axioms become standard such as the ones in the definition of a real vector
space.

These vectors form a linearly independent set (briefly, they are called linearly
independent) if
(1) c a (cid:3) Á(cid:3)c a (cid:2)0
1 (1) m (m)
implies that c (cid:2)0,Á , c (cid:2)0. Otherwise, if (1) also holds with scalars not all zero, the
1 m
vectors are called linearly dependent.
Note that (1) with m(cid:2)1 is ca(cid:2)0 and shows that a single vector a is linearly
independent if and only if a(cid:6)0.
Vhas dimension n,or is n-dimensional,if it contains a linearly independent set of n
vectors, whereas any set of more than n vectors in V is linearly dependent. That set of
n linearly independent vectors is called a basis for V. Then every vector in V can be
written as a linear combination of the basis vectors. Furthermore, for a given basis, this
representation is unique (see Prob. 2).
EXAMPLE 1 Vector Space of Matrices
The real 2(cid:5)2matrices form a four-dimensional real vector space. A basis is

Similarly, the real m(cid:5)n matrices with fixed m and n form an mn-dimensional vector space. What is the
dimension of the vector space of all 3(cid:5)3skew-symmetric matrices? Can you find a basis? (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 2 Vector Space of Polynomials
The set of all constant, linear, and quadratic polynomials in xtogether is a vector space of dimension 3 with
basis {1, x, x2}under the usual addition and multiplication by real numbers because these two operations give
polynomials not exceeding degree 2. What is the dimension of the vector space of all polynomials of degree
(cid:2)
not exceeding a given fixed n? Can you find a basis?
If a vector space Vcontains a linearly independent set of nvectors for every n, no matter
how large, then V is called infinite dimensional, as opposed to a finite dimensional
(n-dimensional) vector space just defined. An example of an infinite dimensional vector
space is the space of all continuous functions on some interval [a, b] of the x-axis, as we
mention without proof.
Inner Product Spaces
If a and b are vectors in Rn, regarded as column vectors, we can form the product aTb.
This is a 1(cid:5)1matrix, which we can identify with its single entry, that is, with a number.
c07.qxd 10/28/10 7:30 PM Page 312
312 CHAP. 7 Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants. Linear Systems
This product is called the inner product or dot product of a and b. Other notations for
it are (a, b) and a•b. Thus

We now extend this concept to general real vector spaces by taking basic properties of
(a, b) as axioms for an “abstract inner product” (a, b) as follows.
DEFINITION Real Inner Product Space
A real vector space V is called a real inner product space (or real pre-Hilbert4
space) if it has the following property. With every pair of vectors aand bin Vthere
is associated a real number, which is denoted by (a, b) and is called the inner
product of a and b, such that the following axioms are satisfied.
I. For all scalars q and q and all vectors a, b, c in V,

III. For every a in V,
(a, a) (cid:10) 0,
(Positive-definiteness).
(a, a) (cid:2)0 if and only if a(cid:2)0
r
Vectors whose inner product is zero are called orthogonal.
The length or norm of a vector in V is defined by
(2) (cid:2)a(cid:2)(cid:2) 2(a, a) ((cid:10) 0).
A vector of norm 1 is called a unit vector.

the creator of the famous Göttingen mathematical school. He is known for his basic work in algebra, the calculus
of variations, integral equations, functional analysis, and mathematical logic. His “Foundations of Geometry”
helped the axiomatic method to gain general recognition. His famous 23 problems (presented in 1900 at the
International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris) considerably influenced the development of modern
mathematics.

vector spaces and inner product spaces. Further details belong to more advanced courses
(on functional analysis, meaning abstract modern analysis; see [GenRef7] listed in App.

play a central role.
Linear Transformations
Let X and Y be any vector spaces. To each vector x in X we assign a unique vector y in
Y. Then we say that a mapping (or transformation or operator) of X into Y is given.
Such a mapping is denoted by a capital letter, say F. The vector yin Yassigned to a vector
xin Xis called the imageof xunder Fand is denoted by F(x)[or Fx,without parentheses].

Linear Transformation of Space Rn into Space Rm
From now on we let X(cid:2)Rn and Y(cid:2)Rm. Then any real m(cid:5)n matrix A(cid:2)[a ] gives

a transformation of Rn into Rm,
(11) y(cid:2)Ax.
Since A(u(cid:3)x)(cid:2)Au(cid:3)Ax and A(cx)(cid:2)cAx, this transformation is linear.
We show that, conversely, every linear transformation F of Rn into Rm can be given
in terms of an m(cid:5)nmatrix A,after a basis for Rnand a basis for Rmhave been chosen.
This can be proved as follows.
Let e ,Á , e be any basis for Rn. Then every x in Rn has a unique representation
(1) (n)
x(cid:2)x e (cid:3) Á (cid:3)x e .
1 (1) n (n)
Since F is linear, this representation implies for the image F(x):

1 (1) n (n) 1 (1) n (n)
Hence F is uniquely determined by the images of the vectors of a basis for Rn. We now

Composition of Linear Transformations
We want to give you a flavor of how linear transformations in general vector spaces work.
You will notice, if you read carefully, that definitions and verifications (Example 7) strictly
follow the given rules and you can think your way through the material by going in a
slow systematic fashion.
The last operation we want to discuss is composition of linear transformations. Let X,
Y, W be general vector spaces. As before, let F be a linear transformation from X to Y.
Let G be a linear transformation from W to X. Then we denote, by H, the composition
of F and G, that is,
H(cid:2)F(cid:3)G(cid:2)FG(cid:2)F(G),
which means we take transformation G and then apply transformation F to it (in that
order!, i.e. you go from left to right).
Now, to give this a more concrete meaning, if we let w be a vector in W, then G(w)
is a vector in X and F(G(w)) is a vector in Y. Thus, H maps W to Y, and we can write
(15) H(w)(cid:2)(F(cid:3)G) (w)(cid:2)(FG) (w)(cid:2)F(G(w)),
which completes the definition of composition in a general vector space setting. But is
composition really linear? To check this we have to verify that H, as defined in (15),obeys
the two equations of (10).
EXAMPLE 7 The Composition of Linear Transformations Is Linear
To show that His indeed linear we must show that (10) holds. We have, for two vectors w , w in W,
1 2
H(w (cid:4)w )(cid:2)(F(cid:3)G)(w (cid:4)w )
1 2 1 2
(cid:2)F(G(w (cid:4)w ))
1 2
(cid:2)F(G(w )(cid:4)G(w )) (by linearity of G)
1 2
(cid:2)F(G(w ))(cid:4)F(G(w )) (by linearity of F)
1 2
(cid:2)(F(cid:3)G)(w )(cid:4)(F(cid:3)G)(w ) (by (15))
1 2
(cid:2)H(w )(cid:4)H(w ) (by definition of H).
1 2
Similarly, H(cw )(cid:2)(F(cid:3)G)(cw )(cid:2)F(G(cw ))(cid:2)F(c(G(w ))
2 2 2 2
(cid:2)cF(G(w ))(cid:2)c(F(cid:3)G)(w )(cid:2)cH(w ). (cid:2)
2 2 2
We defined composition as a linear transformation in a general vector space setting and
showed that the composition of linear transformations is indeed linear.
Next we want to relate composition of linear transformations to matrix multiplication.
To do so we let X(cid:2)Rn, Y(cid:2)Rm, and W(cid:2)Rp. This choice of particular vector spaces
allows us to represent the linear transformations as matrices and form matrix equations,
as was done in (11). Thus F can be represented by a general real m(cid:3)nmatrix A(cid:2) a
3 jk4
and G by an n(cid:3)p matrix B(cid:2) b . Then we can write for F, with column vectors x
3 jk4
with n entries, and resulting vector y, with m entries

and similarly for G, with column vector w with p entries,
(17) x(cid:2)Bw.
Substituting (17) into (16) gives
(18) y(cid:2)Ax (cid:2)A(Bw) (cid:2)(AB)w (cid:2)ABw(cid:2)Cw where C(cid:2)AB.
This is (15) in a matrix setting, this is, we can define the composition of linear transfor-
mations in the Euclidean spaces as multiplication by matrices. Hence, the real m(cid:4)p
matrix C represents a linear transformation H which maps Rp to Rn with vector w, a
column vector with p entries.
Remarks. Our discussion is similar to the one in Sec. 7.2, where we motivated the
“unnatural” matrix multiplication of matrices. Look back and see that our current, more
general, discussion is written out there for the case of dimension m(cid:2)2,n(cid:2)2,and p(cid:2)2.
(You may want to write out our development by picking small distinct dimensions, such
as m(cid:2)2, n(cid:2)3, and p(cid:2)4, and writing down the matrices and vectors. This is a trick
of the trade of mathematicians in that we like to develop and test theories on smaller
examples to see that they work.)
EXAMPLE 8 Linear Transformations. Composition
In Example 5 of Sec. 7.9, let A be the first matrix and B be the fourth matrix with a(cid:3)1. Then, applying B to
a vector w(cid:2)[w w ]T, stretches the element w by a in the x direction. Next, when we apply A to the
1 2 1 1
“stretched” vector, we reflect the vector along the line x (cid:2)x , resulting in a vector y(cid:2)[w aw ]T. But this
1 2 2 1
represents, precisely, a geometric description for the composition H of two linear transformations F and G
represented by matrices A and B. We now show that, for this example, our result can be obtained by
straightforward matrix multiplication, that is,
0 1 a 0 0 1
AB(cid:2) (cid:2)
c1 0d c0 1d ca 0d
and as in (18) calculate
0 1 w w
ABw(cid:2) 1 (cid:2) 2 ,
ca 0d cw d caw d
2 1
which is the same as before. This shows that indeed AB(cid:2)C, and we see the composition of linear
transformations can be represented by a linear transformation. It also shows that the order of matrix multiplication
is important (!). You may want to try applying A first and then B,resulting in BA.What do you see? Does it
(cid:2)
make geometric sense? Is it the same result as AB?
We have learned several abstract concepts such as vector space, inner product space,
and linear transformation. The introduction of such concepts allows engineers and
scientists to communicate in a concise and common language. For example, the concept
of a vector space encapsulated a lot of ideas in a very concise manner. For the student,
learning such concepts provides a foundation for more advanced studies in engineering.
This concludes Chapter 7. The central theme was the Gaussian elimination of Sec. 7.3
from which most of the other concepts and theory flowed. The next chapter again has a
central theme, that is, eigenvalue problems, an area very rich in applications such as in
engineering, modern physics, and other areas.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Linear Algebra: Matrices, Vectors, Determinants.
Linear Systems
An m(cid:5)n matrix A(cid:2)[a ] is a rectangular array of numbers or functions
jk
(“entries,” “elements”) arranged in m horizontal rows and n vertical columns. If
m(cid:2)n, the matrix is called square. A 1(cid:5)n matrix is called a row vector and an
m(cid:5)1 matrix a column vector (Sec. 7.1).
The sum A(cid:3)B of matrices of the same size (i.e., both m(cid:5)n) is obtained by
adding corresponding entries. The product of A by a scalar c is obtained by
multiplying each a by c (Sec. 7.1).
jk
The product C(cid:2)AB of an m(cid:5)n matrix A by an r(cid:5)p matrix B(cid:2)[b ] is
jk
defined only when r(cid:2)n, and is the m(cid:5)p matrix C(cid:2) c with entries

This multiplication is motivated by the composition of linear transformations
(Secs. 7.2, 7.9). It is associative, but is not commutative:if ABis defined, BAmay
not be defined, but even if BAis defined, AB (cid:6)BAin general. Also AB (cid:2)0may
not imply A(cid:2)0 or B(cid:2)0 or BA(cid:2)0 (Secs. 7.2, 7.8). Illustrations:

of solution is the Gauss elimination (Sec. 7.3), which reduces the system to
“triangular” form by elementary row operations, which leave the set of solutions
unchanged. (Numeric aspects and variants, such as Doolittle’s and Cholesky’s
methods, are discussed in Secs. 20.1 and 20.2.)

Summary of Chapter 7 321
Cramer’s rule (Secs. 7.6, 7.7) represents the unknowns in a system (2) of n
equations in n unknowns as quotients of determinants; for numeric work it is
impractical. Determinants(Sec. 7.7) have decreased in importance, but will retain
their place in eigenvalue problems, elementary geometry, etc.
The inverse
A(cid:2)1of
a square matrix satisfies
AA(cid:2)1(cid:2)A(cid:2)1A(cid:2)I.
It exists if and
only if det A (cid:6)0. It can be computed by the Gauss–Jordan elimination(Sec. 7.8).
The rank r of a matrix A is the maximum number of linearly independent rows
or columns of Aor, equivalently, the number of rows of the largest square submatrix
of A with nonzero determinant (Secs. 7.4, 7.7).
The system (2) has solutions if and only if rank A(cid:2)rank [A b], where [A b]
is the augmented matrix (Fundamental Theorem, Sec. 7.5).
The homogeneous system
(3) Ax (cid:2)0
has solutions x(cid:6)0 (“nontrivial solutions”) if and only if rank A(cid:9)n, in the case
m(cid:2)n equivalently if and only if det A (cid:2)0 (Secs. 7.6, 7.7).
Vector spaces, inner product spaces, and linear transformations are discussed in
Sec. 7.9. See also Sec. 7.4.

Linear Algebra:
Matrix Eigenvalue Problems
A matrix eigenvalue problem considers the vector equation
(1) Ax (cid:3)lx.
Here A is a given square matrix, l an unknown scalar, and x an unknown vector. In a
matrix eigenvalue problem, the task is to determine l’s and x’s that satisfy (1). Since
x(cid:3)0 is always a solution for any l and thus not interesting, we only admit solutions
with x(cid:2)0.
The solutions to (1) are given the following names: The l’s that satisfy (1) are called
eigenvalues of A and the corresponding nonzero x’s that also satisfy (1) are called
eigenvectors of A.
From this rather innocent looking vector equation flows an amazing amount of relevant
theory and an incredible richness of applications. Indeed, eigenvalue problems come up
all the time in engineering, physics, geometry, numerics, theoretical mathematics, biology,
environmental science, urban planning, economics, psychology, and other areas. Thus, in
your career you are likely to encounter eigenvalue problems.
We start with a basic and thorough introduction to eigenvalue problems in Sec. 8.1 and
explain (1) with several simple matrices. This is followed by a section devoted entirely
to applications ranging from mass–spring systems of physics to population control models
of environmental science. We show you these diverse examples to train your skills in
modeling and solving eigenvalue problems. Eigenvalue problems for real symmetric,
skew-symmetric, and orthogonal matrices are discussed in Sec. 8.3 and their complex
counterparts (which are important in modern physics) in Sec. 8.5. In Sec. 8.4 we show
how by diagonalizing a matrix, we obtain its eigenvalues.
COMMENT. Numerics for eigenvalues(Secs. 20.6–20.9) can be studied immediately
after this chapter.

The Matrix Eigenvalue Problem. Determining
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Consider multiplying nonzero vectors by a given square matrix, such as

(cid:2) , (cid:2) .
c dc d c d c dc d c d

We want to see what influence the multiplication of the given matrix has on the vectors.
In the first case, we get a totally new vector with a different direction and different length
when compared to the original vector. This is what usually happens and is of no interest
here. In the second case something interesting happens. The multiplication produces a
vector [30 40]T(cid:2)10 [3 4]T, which means the new vector has the same direction as
the original vector. The scale constant, which we denote by l is 10. The problem of
systematically finding suchl’s and nonzero vectors for a given square matrix will be the
theme of this chapter. It is called the matrix eigenvalueproblem or, more commonly, the
eigenvalue problem.
We formalize our observation. Let A(cid:2)[a ] be a given nonzero square matrix of
jk
dimension n(cid:3)n. Consider the following vector equation:
(1) Ax (cid:2)lx.
The problem of finding nonzero x’s and l’s that satisfy equation (1) is called an eigenvalue
problem.
Remark. So A is a given square (!) matrix, x is an unknown vector, and l is an
unknown scalar. Our task is to find l’s and nonzero x’s that satisfy (1). Geometrically,
we are looking for vectors, x, for which the multiplication by A has the same effect as
the multiplication by a scalar l; in other words, Ax should be proportional to x. Thus,
the multiplication has the effect of producing, from the original vector x, a new vector
lxthat has the same or opposite (minus sign) direction as the original vector. (This was
all demonstrated in our intuitive opening example. Can you see that the second equation in
that example satisfies (1) with l(cid:2)10and x(cid:2)[3 4]T,and Athe given 2(cid:3)2matrix?
Write it out.) Now why do we require x to be nonzero? The reason is that x(cid:2)0 is
always a solution of (1) for any value of l, because A0(cid:2)0. This is of no interest.
c08.qxd 10/30/10 10:56 AM Page 324
324 CHAP. 8 Linear Algebra: Matrix Eigenvalue Problems
We introduce more terminology. A value of l, for which (1) has a solution x(cid:2)0, is
called an eigenvalueor characteristic valueof the matrix A. Another term for lis a latent
root. (“Eigen” is German and means “proper” or “characteristic.”). The corresponding
solutions x(cid:2)0 of (1) are called the eigenvectors or characteristic vectors of A
corresponding to that eigenvalue l. The set of all the eigenvalues of A is called the
spectrumof A. We shall see that the spectrum consists of at least one eigenvalue and at
most of n numerically different eigenvalues. The largest of the absolute values of the
eigenvalues of A is called the spectral radius of A, a name to be motivated later.
How to Find Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Now, with the new terminology for (1), we can just say that the problem of determining
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix is called an eigenvalue problem. (However,
more precisely, we are considering an algebraic eigenvalue problem, as opposed to an
eigenvalue problem involving an ODE or PDE, as considered in Secs. 11.5 and 12.3, or
an integral equation.)
Eigenvalues have a very large number of applications in diverse fields such as in
engineering, geometry, physics, mathematics, biology, environmental science, economics,
psychology, and other areas. You will encounter applications for elastic membranes,
Markov processes, population models, and others in this chapter.
Since, from the viewpoint of engineering applications, eigenvalue problems are the most
important problems in connection with matrices, the student should carefully follow our
discussion.
Example 1 demonstrates how to systematically solve a simple eigenvalue problem.

2x (cid:6)((cid:5)2(cid:5)l)x (cid:3)0.

This can be written in matrix notation

because (1) is Ax(cid:5)lx(cid:3)Ax(cid:5)lIx(cid:3)(A(cid:5)lI)x(cid:3)0,which gives (3*). We see that this is a homogeneous
linear system. By Cramer’s theorem in Sec. 7.7 it has a nontrivial solution x(cid:2)0(an eigenvector of Awe are
looking for) if and only if its coefficient determinant is zero, that is,
(cid:5)5(cid:5)l 2

We call D(l)the characteristic determinantor, if expanded, the characteristic polynomial, and D(l)(cid:3)0
the characteristic equationof A. The solutions of this quadratic equation are l (cid:3)(cid:5)1and l (cid:3)(cid:5)6. These

A solution is x (cid:3)2x , as we see from either of the two equations, so that we need only one of them. This

determines an eigenvector corresponding to l (cid:3)(cid:5)1up to a scalar multiple. If we choose x (cid:3)1, we obtain

2x (cid:6)4x (cid:3)0.

A solution is x (cid:3)(cid:5)x 2with arbitrary x . If we choose x (cid:3)2, we get x (cid:3)(cid:5)1.Thus an eigenvector of A

For the matrix in the intuitive opening example at the start of Sec. 8.1, the characteristic equation is
l2(cid:5)13l(cid:6)30(cid:3)(l(cid:5)10)(l(cid:5)3)(cid:3)0. The eigenvalues are {10, 3}. Corresponding eigenvectors are

A(cid:5)lIis called the characteristic matrixand D(l)the characteristic determinantof
A. Equation (4) is called the characteristic equationof A. By developing D(l)we obtain
a polynomial of nth degree in l. This is called the characteristic polynomial of A.
This proves the following important theorem.
THEOREM 1 Eigenvalues
The eigenvalues of a square matrix A are the roots of the characteristic equation
(4) of A.
Hence an n (cid:4) n matrix has at least one eigenvalue and at most n numerically
different eigenvalues.
For larger n, the actual computation of eigenvalues will, in general, require the use
of Newton’s method (Sec. 19.2) or another numeric approximation method in Secs.
20.7–20.9.
The eigenvalues must be determined first. Once these are known, corresponding
eigenvectors are obtained from the system (2), for instance, by the Gauss elimination,
where l is the eigenvalue for which an eigenvector is wanted. This is what we did in
Example 1 and shall do again in the examples below. (To prevent misunderstandings:
numeric approximation methods, such as in Sec. 20.8, may determine eigenvectors first.)
Eigenvectors have the following properties.
THEOREM 2 Eigenvectors, Eigenspace
Ifwandxare eigenvectors of a matrixAcorresponding tothe sameeigenvaluel,
so are w(cid:6)x(provided x(cid:2)(cid:5)w) and kxfor any k(cid:2)0.
Hence the eigenvectors corresponding to one and the same eigenvalue l of A,
together with 0, form a vector space (cf. Sec. 7.4), called the eigenspace of A
corresponding to that l.
PROOF Aw (cid:3)lw and Ax(cid:3)lx imply A(w (cid:6)x)(cid:3)Aw(cid:6)Ax (cid:3)lw(cid:6)lx(cid:3)l(w (cid:6)x) and
A(kw)(cid:3)k(Aw)(cid:3)k(lw)(cid:3)l(kw); hence A(kw(cid:6)/x)(cid:3)l(kw(cid:6)/x). (cid:2)
In particular, an eigenvector x is determined only up to a constant factor. Hence we
can normalize x, that is, multiply it by a scalar to get a unit vector (see Sec. 7.9). For
instance, x (cid:3)[1 2]T in Example 1 has the length (cid:2)x (cid:2)(cid:3) 212(cid:6)22(cid:3) 15; hence
1 1
[1 15 2 15]T is a normalized eigenvector (a unit eigenvector).

SEC. 8.1 The Matrix Eigenvalue Problem. Determining Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors 327
Examples 2 and 3 will illustrate that an n(cid:4)nmatrix may have nlinearly independent
eigenvectors, or it may have fewer than n. In Example 4 we shall see that a real matrix
may have complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Solution. For our matrix, the characteristic determinant gives the characteristic equation
(cid:5)l3(cid:5)l2(cid:6)21l(cid:6)45(cid:3)0.
The roots (eigenvalues of A) are l (cid:3)5, l (cid:3)l (cid:3)(cid:5)3.(If you have trouble finding roots, you may want to
1 2 3
use a root finding algorithm such as Newton’s method (Sec. 19.2). Your CAS or scientific calculator can find
roots. However, to really learn and remember this material, you have to do some exercises with paper and pencil.)
To find eigenvectors, we apply the Gauss elimination (Sec. 7.3) to the system (A(cid:5)lI)x(cid:3)0, first with l(cid:3)5
and then with l(cid:3)(cid:5)3. For l(cid:3)5the characteristic matrix is
(cid:5)7 2 (cid:5)3 (cid:5)7 2 (cid:5)3
A(cid:5)lI(cid:3)A(cid:5)5I(cid:3) 2 (cid:5)4 (cid:5)6 . It row-reduces to 0 (cid:5)24 (cid:5)48 .
7 7
(cid:5)1 (cid:5)2 (cid:5)5 0 0 0
Hence it has rank 2. Choosing D x (cid:3)(cid:5)1 we haT ve x (cid:3)2 from (cid:5)24x (cid:5)4D8x (cid:3)0 and then xT (cid:3)1 from
3 2 7 2 7 3 1
(cid:5)7x (cid:6)2x (cid:5)3x (cid:3)0.Hence an eigenvector of Acorresponding to l(cid:3)5is x (cid:3)[1 2 (cid:5)1]T.

For l(cid:3)(cid:5)3the characteristic matrix
1 2 (cid:5)3 1 2 (cid:5)3
A(cid:5)lI(cid:3)A(cid:6)3I(cid:3) 2 4 (cid:5)6 row-reduces to 0 0 0 .

Hence it has rank 1. From x (cid:6)2xD(cid:5)3x (cid:3)0 weT have x (cid:3)(cid:5)2x (cid:6)3x .D Choosing x (cid:3)T 1, x (cid:3)0 and

x (cid:3)0, x (cid:3)1, we obtain two linearly independent eigenvectors of Acorresponding to l(cid:3)(cid:5)3[as they must

The order M of an eigenvalue l as a root oDf Tthe characteristic polynomial is called the

algebraic multiplicity of l. The number m of linearly independent eigenvectors
l
corresponding to l is called the geometric multiplicity of l. Thus m is the dimension
l
of the eigenspace corresponding to this l.
c08.qxd 10/30/10 10:56 AM Page 328

Since the characteristic polynomial has degree n, the sum of all the algebraic
multiplicities must equal n. In Example 2 for l(cid:3)(cid:5)3we have m (cid:3)M (cid:3)2.In general,
l l
m (cid:7)M , as can be shown. The difference ¢ (cid:3)M (cid:5)m is called the defect of l.

EXAMPLE 4 Real Matrices with Complex Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Since real polynomials may have complex roots (which then occur in conjugate pairs), a real matrix may have
complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For instance, the characteristic equation of the skew-symmetric matrix

A(cid:3) is det (A(cid:5)lI)(cid:3) (cid:3)l2(cid:6)1(cid:3)0.

Some Applications of Eigenvalue Problems
We have selected some typical examples from the wide range of applications of matrix
eigenvalue problems. The last example, that is, Example 4, shows an application involving
vibrating springs and ODEs. It falls into the domain of Chapter 4, which covers matrix
eigenvalue problems related to ODE’s modeling mechanical systems and electrical
c08.qxd 10/30/10 10:56 AM Page 330
330 CHAP. 8 Linear Algebra: Matrix Eigenvalue Problems
networks. Example 4 is included to keep our discussion independent of Chapter 4.
(However, the reader not interested in ODEs may want to skip Example 4 without loss
of continuity.)
EXAMPLE 1 Stretching of an Elastic Membrane
An elastic membrane in the x x -plane with boundary circle x2(cid:6)x2(cid:3)1(Fig. 160) is stretched so that a point
1 2 1 2
P: (x , x )goes over into the point Q: (y , y )given by
1 2 1 2
y 5 3 x y (cid:3)5x (cid:6)3x
(1) y(cid:3) 1 (cid:3)Ax(cid:3) 1 ; in components, 1 1 2
cy d c3 5dcx d y (cid:3)3x (cid:6)5x .
2 2 2 1 2
Find the principal directions, that is, the directions of the position vector xof Pfor which the direction of the
position vector yof Qis the same or exactly opposite. What shape does the boundary circle take under this
deformation?
Solution. We are looking for vectors xsuch that y(cid:3)lx. Since y(cid:3)Ax, this gives Ax(cid:3)lx, the equation
of an eigenvalue problem. In components, Ax(cid:3)lxis
5x (cid:6)3x (cid:3)lx (5(cid:5)l)x (cid:6) 3x (cid:3)0
1 2 1 1 2
(2) or
3x (cid:6)5x (cid:3)lx 3x (cid:6)(5(cid:5)l)x (cid:3)0.
1 2 2 1 2
The characteristic equation is
5(cid:5)l 3
(3) (cid:3)(5(cid:5)l)2(cid:5)9(cid:3)0.
3 5(cid:5)l
Its solutions are l (cid:3)8and l (cid:3)2.These are the eigenvalues of our problem. For l(cid:3)l (cid:3)8,our system (2)
1 2 2 2 1
becomes
(cid:5)3x (cid:6)3x (cid:3)0, Solution x (cid:3)x , x arbitrary,
1 2 2 1 1
3x (cid:5)3x (cid:3)0. for instance, x (cid:3)x (cid:3)1.
1 2 1 2
For l (cid:3)2, our system (2) becomes
2 2
3x (cid:6)3x (cid:3)0, Solution x (cid:3)(cid:5)x , x arbitrary,
1 2 2 1 1
3x (cid:6)3x (cid:3)0. for instance, x (cid:3)1, x (cid:3)(cid:5)1.
1 2 1 2
We thus obtain as eigenvectors of A, for instance, [1 1]Tcorresponding to l and [1 (cid:5)1]Tcorresponding to
2 1
l (or a nonzero scalar multiple of these). These vectors make 45°and 135°angles with the positive x-direction.
2 1
They give the principal directions, the answer to our problem. The eigenvalues show that in the principal
directions the membrane is stretched by factors 8 and 2, respectively; see Fig. 160.
Accordingly, if we choose the principal directions as directions of a new Cartesian u u -coordinate system,
1 2
say, with the positive u -semi-axis in the first quadrant and the positive u -semi-axis in the second quadrant of
1 2
the x x -system, and if we set u (cid:3)r cos (cid:2), u (cid:3)r sin (cid:2), then a boundary point of the unstretched circular
1 2 1 2
membrane has coordinates cos (cid:2), sin (cid:2).Hence, after the stretch we have
z (cid:3)8 cos (cid:2), z (cid:3)2 sin (cid:2).
1 2
Since cos2 (cid:2)(cid:6)sin2 (cid:2)(cid:3)1, this shows that the deformed boundary is an ellipse (Fig. 160)

EXAMPLE 2 Eigenvalue Problems Arising from Markov Processes
Markov processes as considered in Example 13 of Sec. 7.2 lead to eigenvalue problems if we ask for the limit
state of the process in which the state vector xis reproduced under the multiplication by the stochastic matrix
Agoverning the process, that is, Ax(cid:3)x. Hence Ashould have the eigenvalue 1, and xshould be a corresponding
eigenvector. This is of practical interest because it shows the long-term tendency of the development modeled
by the process.

We try a vector solution of the form

By addition and subtraction (see Sec. 2.2) we get the four real solutions

Orthogonal Transformations and Orthogonal Matrices
Orthogonal transformations are transformations
(5) y(cid:3)Ax where A is an orthogonal matrix.
With each vector x in Rn such a transformation assigns a vector y in Rn. For instance,
the plane rotation through an angle u
y cos u (cid:5)sin u x

(6) y(cid:3) (cid:3)
cy d c sin u cos udcx d

is an orthogonal transformation. It can be shown that any orthogonal transformation in
the plane or in three-dimensional space is a rotation(possibly combined with a reflection
in a straight line or a plane, respectively).
The main reason for the importance of orthogonal matrices is as follows.
THEOREM 2 Invariance of Inner Product
An orthogonal transformation preserves the value of the inner product of vectors
a and b in Rn, defined by
b

(7) a•b(cid:3)aTb(cid:3)[a Á a ] . .

n
That is, for any a and b in Rn, orthogonal n(cid:4)n maDtrixTA, and u(cid:3)Aa, v(cid:3)Ab
we have u•v(cid:3)a•b.
Hence the transformation also preserves the length or norm of any vector a in
Rn given by
(8) (cid:2)a(cid:2)(cid:3) 1a•a(cid:3) 2aTa.
PROOF Let A be orthogonal. Let u(cid:3)Aa and v(cid:3)Ab. We must show that u•v(cid:3)a•b. Now
(Aa)T(cid:3)aTAT by (10d) in Sec. 7.2 and ATA(cid:3)A(cid:2)1A(cid:3)I by (3). Hence
(9) u•v(cid:3)uTv(cid:3)(Aa)TAb (cid:3)aTATAb (cid:3)aTIb (cid:3)aTb(cid:3)a•b.
From this the invariance of (cid:2)a(cid:2) follows if we set b(cid:3)a. (cid:2)

Orthogonal matrices have further interesting properties as follows.
THEOREM 3 Orthonormality of Column and Row Vectors

also its row vectors) form an orthonormal system, that is,

The last equality implies (10)D, byT the definition Dof the n(cid:4)n unit matrix I. FTrom (3) it
follows that the inverse of an orthogonal matrix is orthogonal (see CAS Experiment 12).
Now the column vectors of
A(cid:2)1((cid:3)AT)
are the row vectors of A. Hence the row vectors
of A also form an orthonormal system.
(b) Conversely, if the column vectors of A satisfy (10), the off-diagonal entries in (11)
must be 0 and the diagonal entries 1. Hence ATA(cid:3)I, as (11) shows. Similarly, AAT(cid:3)I.
This implies
AT(cid:3)A(cid:2)1because
also
A(cid:2)1A(cid:3)AA(cid:2)1(cid:3)Iand
the inverse is unique. Hence
A is orthogonal. Similarly when the row vectors of A form an orthonormal system, by
what has been said at the end of part (a). (cid:2)
THEOREM 4 Determinant of an Orthogonal Matrix
The determinant of an orthogonal matrix has the value (cid:6)1 or (cid:5)1.
PROOF From det AB (cid:3)det A det B (Sec. 7.8, Theorem 4) and det AT(cid:3)det A (Sec. 7.7,
Theorem 2d), we get for an orthogonal matrix
1(cid:3)det I(cid:3)det(AA(cid:2)1)(cid:3)det(AAT)(cid:3)det A det AT(cid:3)(det A)2. (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 4 Illustration of Theorems 3 and 4
The last matrix in Example 1 and the matrix in (6) illustrate Theorems 3 and 4 because their determinants are
(cid:5)1and (cid:6)1, as you should verify. (cid:2)
THEOREM 5 Eigenvalues of an Orthogonal Matrix
The eigenvalues of an orthogonal matrixAare real or complex conjugates in pairs
and have absolute value 1.
c08.qxd 10/30/10 10:56 AM Page 338
338 CHAP. 8 Linear Algebra: Matrix Eigenvalue Problems
PROOF The first part of the statement holds for any real matrix A because its characteristic
polynomial has real coefficients, so that its zeros (the eigenvalues of A) must be as
indicated. The claim that ƒlƒ (cid:3)1 will be proved in Sec. 8.5. (cid:2)

gives (cid:5)(l2(cid:5)5l 3(cid:6)1)(cid:3)0and the two eigenvalues (5(cid:6)i111) 6and (5(cid:5)i111) 6, which have absolute

Eigenbases. Diagonalization.
Quadratic Forms
So far we have emphasized properties of eigenvalues.We now turn to general properties
of eigenvectors. Eigenvectors of an n(cid:4)n matrix A may (or may not!) form a basis for
Rn. If we are interested in a transformation y(cid:3)Ax, such an “eigenbasis” (basis of
eigenvectors)—if it exists—is of great advantage because then we can represent any xin
Rn uniquely as a linear combination of the eigenvectors x ,Á , x , say,
1 n
x(cid:3)c x (cid:6)c x (cid:6) Á (cid:6)c x .
1 1 2 2 n n
And, denoting the corresponding (not necessarily distinct) eigenvalues of the matrix Aby
l ,Á , l , we have Ax (cid:3)lx, so that we simply obtain
1 n j j j
y(cid:3)Ax (cid:3)A(c x (cid:6) Á (cid:6)c x )

1 1 n n
(cid:3)c l x (cid:6) Á (cid:6)c l x .
1 1 1 n n n
This shows that we have decomposed the complicated action of Aon an arbitrary vector
x into a sum of simple actions (multiplication by scalars) on the eigenvectors of A. This
is the point of an eigenbasis.
Now if the n eigenvalues are all different, we do obtain a basis:
THEOREM 1 Basis of Eigenvectors
If an n(cid:4)nmatrixAhas ndistincteigenvalues, thenAhas a basis of eigenvectors
x ,Á , x for Rn.
1 n

PROOF All we have to show is that x , , x are linearly independent. Suppose they are not. Let
1 n
r be the largest integer such that {x ,Á , x } is a linearly independent set. Then r(cid:8)n
1 r
Á Á
and the set {x , , x , x } is linearly dependent. Thus there are scalars c , , c ,
1 r r(cid:6)1 1 r(cid:6)1
not all zero, such that
(2) c x (cid:6) Á (cid:6)c x (cid:3)0
1 1 r(cid:6)1 r(cid:6)1
(see Sec. 7.4). Multiplying both sides by A and using Ax (cid:3)lx, we obtain
j j j
(3) A(c x (cid:6) Á (cid:6)c x )(cid:3)c l x (cid:6) Á (cid:6)c l x (cid:3)A0(cid:3) 0.
1 1 r(cid:6)1 r(cid:6)1 1 1 1 r(cid:6)1 r(cid:6)1 r(cid:6)1
To get rid of the last term, we subtract l times (2) from this, obtaining
r(cid:6)1
c (l (cid:5)l )x (cid:6) Á (cid:6)c (l (cid:5)l )x (cid:3)0.
1 1 r(cid:6)1 1 r r r(cid:6)1 r
Here c (l (cid:5)l )(cid:3)0,Á , c (l (cid:5)l )(cid:3)0since {x ,Á ,x }is linearly independent.
1 1 r(cid:6)1 r r r(cid:6)1 1 r
Hence c (cid:3) Á (cid:3)c (cid:3)0, since all the eigenvalues are distinct. But with this, (2) reduces to
1 r
c x (cid:3)0, hence c (cid:3)0, since x (cid:2)0 (an eigenvector!). This contradicts the fact
r(cid:6)1 r(cid:6)1 r(cid:6)1 r(cid:6)1
that not all scalars in (2) are zero. Hence the conclusion of the theorem must hold. (cid:2)

Similarity of Matrices. Diagonalization
Eigenbases also play a role in reducing a matrix Ato a diagonal matrix whose entries are
the eigenvalues of A. This is done by a “similarity transformation,” which is defined as
follows (and will have various applications in numerics in Chap. 20).
DEFINITION Similar Matrices. Similarity Transformation
An n(cid:4)n matrix Aˆ is called similar to an n(cid:4)n matrix A if
(4) Aˆ (cid:3)P(cid:2)1AP
for some (nonsingular!) n(cid:4)n matrix P. This transformation, which gives Aˆ from
A, is called a similarity transformation.
The key property of this transformation is that it preserves the eigenvalues of A:
THEOREM 3 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of Similar Matrices
If Aˆ is similar to A, then Aˆ has the same eigenvalues as A.
Furthermore, if x is an eigenvector of A, then y(cid:3)P(cid:2)1x is an eigenvector of Aˆ
corresponding to the same eigenvalue.

SEC. 8.4 Eigenbases. Diagonalization. Quadratic Forms 341
PROOF From Ax (cid:3)lx (l an eigenvalue, x(cid:2)0) we get P(cid:2)1Ax (cid:3)lP(cid:2)1x. Now I(cid:3)PP(cid:2)1. By
this identity trick the equation
P(cid:2)1Ax (cid:3)lP(cid:2)1x
gives

Hence lis an eigenvalue of Aˆ and P(cid:2)1xa corresponding eigenvector. Indeed, P(cid:2)1x(cid:2)0
because P(cid:2)1x(cid:3)0 would give x(cid:3)Ix (cid:3)PP(cid:2)1x(cid:3)P0 (cid:3)0, contradicting x(cid:2)0. (cid:2)

We confirm the second part. From the first component of (A(cid:5)lI)x(cid:3)0we have (6(cid:5)l)x (cid:5)3x (cid:3)0. For

Indeed, these are eigenvectors of the diagonal matrix Aˆ.
Perhaps we see that x and x are the columns of P. This suggests the general method of transforming a
matrix Ato diagonal form1 Dby 2 using P(cid:3)X,the matrix with eigenvectors as columns. (cid:2)
By a suitable similarity transformation we can now transform a matrix A to a diagonal
matrix D whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of A:
THEOREM 4 Diagonalization of a Matrix
If an n(cid:4)n matrix A has a basis of eigenvectors, then
(5)
D(cid:3)X(cid:2)1AX
is diagonal, with the eigenvalues ofAas the entries on the main diagonal. HereX
is the matrix with these eigenvectors as column vectors. Also,

where D is the diagonal matrix as in (5). The fourth equality in (6) follows by direct
calculation. (Try it for n(cid:3)2and then for general n.) The third equality uses Ax (cid:3)l x .
k k k
The second equality results if we note that the first column of AX is A times the first
column of X, which is x , and so on. For instance, when n(cid:3)2 and we write

Quadratic forms occur in physics and geometry, for instance, in connection with conic
sections (ellipses x2 a2(cid:6)x2 b2(cid:3)1, etc.) and quadratic surfaces (cones, etc.). Their
1> 2>
transformation to principal axes is an important practical task related to the diagonalization
of matrices, as follows.
By Theorem 2, the symmetric coefficient matrix A of (7) has an orthonormal basis of
eigenvectors. Hence if we take these as column vectors, we obtain a matrix X that is
orthogonal, so that
X(cid:2)1(cid:3)XT.
From (5) we thus have
A(cid:3)XDX(cid:2)1(cid:3)XDXT.
Substitution
into (7) gives
(8) Q(cid:3)xTXDXTx.
If we set XTx(cid:3)y, then, since XT(cid:3)X(cid:2)1, we have X(cid:2)1x(cid:3)y and thus obtain
(9) x(cid:3)Xy.
Furthermore, in (8) we have xTX(cid:3)(XTx)T(cid:3)yTand XTx(cid:3)y,so that Qbecomes simply
(10) Q(cid:3)yTDy (cid:3)l y2(cid:6)l y2(cid:6) Á (cid:6)l y2.

EXAMPLE 6 Transformation to Principal Axes. Conic Sections

This gives the characteristic equation (17(cid:5)l)2(cid:5)152(cid:3)0. It has the roots l (cid:3)2, l (cid:3)32. Hence (10)
1 2
becomes
Q(cid:3)2y2(cid:6)32y2.

The three classes of matrices in Sec. 8.3 have complex counterparts which are of practical
interest in certain applications, for instance, in quantum mechanics. This is mainly because
of their spectra as shown in Theorem 1 in this section. The second topic is about extending
quadratic forms of Sec. 8.4 to complex numbers. (The reader who wants to brush up on
complex numbers may want to consult Sec. 13.1.)

DEFINITION Hermitian, Skew-Hermitian, and Unitary Matrices
A square matrix A(cid:3) a is called
3 kj4
Hermitian if AT(cid:3)A, that is, a (cid:3)a
kj jk
skew-Hermitian if AT(cid:3)(cid:5)A, that is, a (cid:3)(cid:5)a
kj jk
unitary if
AT(cid:3)A(cid:2)1.
The first two classes are named after Hermite (see footnote 13 in Problem Set 5.8).
From the definitions we see the following. If A is Hermitian, the entries on the main
diagonal must satisfy a (cid:3)a ; that is, they are real. Similarly, if A is skew-Hermitian,
jj jj
then a (cid:3)(cid:5)a .If we set a (cid:3)a(cid:6)ib,this becomes a(cid:5)ib(cid:3)(cid:5)(a(cid:6)ib).Hence a(cid:3)0,
jj jj jj
so that a must be pure imaginary or 0.

are Hermitian, skew-Hermitian, and unitary matrices, respectively, as you may verify by using the definitions.
If a Hermitian matrix is real, then AT(cid:3)AT(cid:3)A. Hence a real Hermitian matrix is a
symmetric matrix (Sec. 8.3).
Similarly, if a skew-Hermitian matrix is real, then AT(cid:3)AT(cid:3)(cid:5)A.Hence a real skew-
Hermitian matrix is a skew-symmetric matrix.
Finally, if a unitary matrix is real, then
AT(cid:3)AT(cid:3)A(cid:2)1.
Hence a real unitary matrix
is an orthogonal matrix.
This shows that Hermitian, skew-Hermitian, and unitary matrices generalize symmetric,
skew-symmetric, and orthogonal matrices, respectively.
Eigenvalues
It is quite remarkable that the matrices under consideration have spectra (sets of eigenvalues;
see Sec. 8.1) that can be characterized in a general way as follows (see Fig. 163).

PROOF We prove Theorem 1. Let lbe an eigenvalue and xan eigenvector of A. Multiply Ax (cid:3)lx

ƒx ƒ2 (cid:6) Á (cid:6) ƒx ƒ2, which is real and not 0 because x(cid:2)0. This gives
1 n
xTAx
(1) l(cid:3) .
xTx
(a) If Ais Hermitian, AT(cid:3)Aor AT(cid:3)Aand we show that then the numerator in (1)
is real, which makes lreal. xTAxis a scalar; hence taking the transpose has no effect. Thus
(2) xTAx (cid:3)(xTAx)T(cid:3)xTATx(cid:3)xTAx(cid:3)(xTAx).
Hence, xTAx equals its complex conjugate, so that it must be real. (a(cid:6)ib (cid:3)a(cid:5)ib
implies b(cid:3)0.)
(b) If A is skew-Hermitian, AT(cid:3)(cid:5)A and instead of (2) we obtain
(3) xTAx(cid:3)(cid:5)(xTAx)
so that xTAx equals minus its complex conjugate and is pure imaginary or 0.
(a(cid:6)ib(cid:3)(cid:5)(a(cid:5)ib) implies a(cid:3)0.)
(c) Let A be unitary. We take Ax (cid:3)lx and its conjugate transpose
(Ax)T(cid:3)(lx)T(cid:3)lxT
and multiply the two left sides and the two right sides,
(Ax)TAx (cid:3)llxTx(cid:3) ƒlƒ2xTx.

(Ax)TAx (cid:3)xTATAx (cid:3)xTA(cid:2)1Ax(cid:3)xTIx (cid:3)xTx.
Together, xTx(cid:3) ƒlƒ2xTx. We now divide by xTx ((cid:2)0) to get ƒlƒ2(cid:3)1. Hence ƒlƒ (cid:3)1.
This proves Theorem 1 as well as Theorems 1 and 5 in Sec. 8.3. (cid:2)
Key properties of orthogonal matrices (invariance of the inner product, orthonormality of
rows and columns; see Sec. 8.3) generalize to unitary matrices in a remarkable way.
To see this, instead of Rn we now use the complex vector space Cn of all complex
vectors with n complex numbers as components, and complex numbers as scalars. For
such complex vectors the inner productis defined by (note the overbar for the complex
conjugate)
(4) a•b(cid:3)aTb.
The length or norm of such a complex vector is a real number defined by

THEOREM 2 Invariance of Inner Product
A unitary transformation, that is, y(cid:3)Ax with a unitary matrix A, preserves the
value of the inner product (4), hence also the norm (5).
PROOF The proof is the same as that of Theorem 2 in Sec. 8.3, which the theorem generalizes.
In the analog of (9), Sec. 8.3, we now have bars,

The complex analog of an orthonormal system of real vectors (see Sec. 8.3) is defined as
follows.

A complex square matrix is unitary if and only if its column vectors (and also its
row vectors) form a unitary system.

THEOREM 4 Determinant of a Unitary Matrix
Let A be a unitary matrix. Then its determinant has absolute value one, that is,
ƒdet Aƒ (cid:3)1.
PROOF Similarly, as in Sec. 8.3, we obtain
1(cid:3)det (AA(cid:2)1)(cid:3)det (AAT)(cid:3)det A det AT(cid:3)det A det A
(cid:3)det A det A(cid:3) ƒdet Aƒ2.
Hence ƒdet Aƒ (cid:3)1 (where det A may now be complex). (cid:2)

THEOREM 5 Basis of Eigenvectors
A Hermitian, skew-Hermitian, or unitary matrix has a basis of eigenvectors for Cn
that is a unitary system.

Hermitian and Skew-Hermitian Forms
The concept of a quadratic form (Sec. 8.4) can be extended to complex. We call the
numerator xTAx in (1) a form in the components x ,Á , x of x, which may now be
1 n
complex. This form is again a sum of n2 terms

A is called its coefficient matrix. The form is called a Hermitian or skew-Hermitian
form if A is Hermitian or skew-Hermitian, respectively. The value of a Hermitian form
is real, and that of a skew-Hermitian form is pure imaginary or zero. This can be seen
directly from (2) and (3) and accounts for the importance of these forms in physics. Note
that (2) and (3) are valid for any vectors because, in the proof of (2) and (3), we did not
use that x is an eigenvector but only that xTx is real and not 0.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Linear Algebra: Matrix Eigenvalue Problems
The practical importance of matrix eigenvalue problems can hardly be overrated.
The problems are defined by the vector equation
(1) Ax (cid:3)lx.
Ais a given square matrix. All matrices in this chapter are square. lis a scalar. To
solve the problem (1) means to determine values of l, called eigenvalues (or
characteristic values) of A,such that (1) has a nontrivial solution x(that is, x(cid:2)0),
called an eigenvector of A corresponding to that l. An n(cid:4)n matrix has at least
one and at most nnumerically different eigenvalues. These are the solutions of the
characteristic equation (Sec. 8.1)

D(l) is called the characteristic determinant of A. By expanding it we get the
characteristic polynomialof A,which is of degree nin l. Some typical applications
are shown in Sec. 8.2.
Section 8.3 is devoted to eigenvalue problems for symmetric (AT(cid:3)A), skew-
symmetric (AT(cid:3)(cid:5)A), and orthogonal matrices (AT(cid:3)A(cid:2)1). Section 8.4
concerns the diagonalization of matrices and the transformation of quadratic forms
to principal axes and its relation to eigenvalues.
Section 8.5 extends Sec. 8.3 to the complex analogs of those real matrices, called
Hermitian (AT(cid:3)A), skew-Hermitian (AT(cid:3)(cid:5)A), and unitary matrices
(AT(cid:3)A(cid:2)1).
All the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix (and a symmetric one) are
real. For a skew-Hermitian (and a skew-symmetric) matrix they are pure imaginary
or zero. For a unitary (and an orthogonal) matrix they have absolute value 1.

Vector Differential Calculus.
Grad, Div, Curl
Engineering, physics, and computer sciences, in general, but particularly solid mechanics,
aerodynamics, aeronautics, fluid flow, heat flow, electrostatics, quantum physics, laser
technology, robotics as well as other areas have applications that require an understanding
ofvector calculus.This field encompasses vector differential calculus and vector integral
calculus. Indeed, the engineer, physicist, and mathematician need a good grounding in
these areas as provided by the carefully chosen material of Chaps. 9 and 10.
Forces, velocities, and various other quantities may be thought of as vectors. Vectors
appear frequently in the applications above and also in the biological and social sciences,
so it is natural that problems are modeled in 3-space. This is the space of three dimensions
with the usual measurement of distance, as given by the Pythagorean theorem. Within that
realm, 2-space (the plane) is a special case. Working in 3-space requires that we extend
the common differential calculus to vector differential calculus, that is, the calculus that
deals with vector functions and vector fields and is explained in this chapter.
Chapter 9 is arranged in three groups of sections. Sections 9.1–9.3 extend the basic
algebraic operations of vectors into 3-space. These operations include the inner product
and the cross product. Sections 9.4 and 9.5 form the heart of vector differential calculus.
Finally, Secs. 9.7–9.9 discuss three physically important concepts related to scalar and
vector fields: gradient (Sec. 9.7), divergence (Sec. 9.8), and curl (Sec. 9.9). They are
expressed in Cartesian coordinates in this chapter and, if desired, expressed in curvilinear
coordinates in a short section in App. A3.4.
We shall keep this chapter independent of Chaps.7 and8. Our present approach is in
harmony with Chap. 7, with the restriction to two and three dimensions providing for a
richer theory with basic physical, engineering, and geometric applications.
Prerequisite: Elementary use of second- and third-order determinants in Sec. 9.3.
Sections that may be omitted in a shorter course: 9.5, 9.6.

9.1
Vectors in 2-Space and 3-Space
In engineering, physics, mathematics, and other areas we encounter two kinds of quantities.
They are scalars and vectors.
A scalaris a quantity that is determined by its magnitude. It takes on a numerical value,
i.e., a number. Examples of scalars are time, temperature, length, distance, speed, density,
energy, and voltage.
354
c09.qxd 10/30/10 3:25 PM Page 355
SEC. 9.1 Vectors in 2-Space and 3-Space 355
In contrast, a vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. We can say
that a vector is an arrow or a directed line segment. For example, a velocity vector has
length or magnitude, which is speed, and direction, which indicates the direction of motion.
Typical examples of vectors are displacement, velocity, and force, see Fig. 164 as an
illustration.
More formally, we have the following. We denote vectors by lowercase boldface letters
a, b, v, etc. In handwriting you may use arrows, for instance, a(cid:2) (in place of a), b(cid:2) , etc.
A vector (arrow) has a tail, called its initial point, and a tip, called its terminal point.
This is motivated in the translation (displacement without rotation) of the triangle in
Fig. 165, where the initial point P of the vector a is the original position of a point, and
the terminal point Qis the terminal position of that point, its position afterthe translation.
The length of the arrow equals the distance between P and Q. This is called the length
(or magnitude) of the vector a and is denoted by ƒaƒ. Another name for length is norm
(or Euclidean norm).
A vector of length 1 is called a unit vector.

Of course, we would like to calculate with vectors. For instance, we want to find the
resultant of forces or compare parallel forces of different magnitude. This motivates our
next ideas: to define componentsof a vector, and then the two basic algebraic operations
of vector addition and scalar multiplication.
For this we must first define equality of vectorsin a way that is practical in connection
with forces and other applications.
DEFINITION Equality of Vectors
Two vectors aand bare equal, written a(cid:2)b, if they have the same length and the
same direction [as explained in Fig. 166; in particular, note (B)]. Hence a vector
can be arbitrarily translated; that is, its initial point can be chosen arbitrarily.

Components of a Vector
We choose an xyz Cartesian coordinate system1 in space (Fig. 167), that is, a usual
rectangular coordinate system with the same scale of measurement on the three mutually
perpendicular coordinate axes. Let abe a given vector with initial point P: (x , y , z )and
1 1 1
terminal point Q: (x , y , z ). Then the three coordinate differences

(1) a (cid:2)x (cid:3)x , a (cid:2)y (cid:3)y , a (cid:2)z (cid:3)z
1 2 1 2 2 1 3 2 1
are called the componentsof the vector awith respect to that coordinate system, and we
write simply a(cid:2)[a , a , a ]. See Fig. 168.
1 2 3
The length ƒaƒ of acan now readily be expressed in terms of components because from
(1) and the Pythagorean theorem we have
(2) ƒaƒ (cid:2) 2a2(cid:4)a2(cid:4)a2.
1 2 3
EXAMPLE 1 Components and Length of a Vector
The vector awith initial point P: (4, 0, 2)and terminal point Q: (6, (cid:3)1, 2)has the components
a (cid:2)6(cid:3)4(cid:2)2, a (cid:2)(cid:3)1(cid:3)0(cid:2)(cid:3)1, a (cid:2)2(cid:3)2(cid:2)0.
1 2 3
Hence a(cid:2)[2, (cid:3)1, 0].(Can you sketch a, as in Fig. 168?) Equation (2) gives the length
ƒaƒ (cid:2) 222(cid:4)((cid:3)1)2(cid:4)02(cid:2) 15.
If we choose ((cid:3)1, 5, 8)as the initial point of a, the corresponding terminal point is (1, 4, 8).
If we choose the origin (0, 0, 0) as the initial point of a, the corresponding terminal point is (2, (cid:3)1, 0);its
coordinates equal the components of a. This suggests that we can determine each point in space by a vector,
(cid:2)
called the position vectorof the point, as follows.
A Cartesian coordinate system being given, the position vector r of a point A: (x, y, z)
is the vector with the origin (0, 0, 0) as the initial point and A as the terminal point (see
Fig. 169). Thus in components, r(cid:2)[x, y, z]. This can be seen directly from (1) with
x (cid:2)y (cid:2)z (cid:2)0.

DESCARTES (1596–1650), who invented analytic geometry. His basic work Géométrieappeared in 1637, as
an appendix to his Discours de la méthode.
SEC. 9.1 Vectors in 2-Space and 3-Space 357
Furthermore, if we translate a vector a, with initial point P and terminal point Q, then
corresponding coordinates of Pand Qchange by the same amount, so that the differences
in (1) remain unchanged. This proves
THEOREM 1 Vectors as Ordered Triples of Real Numbers
A fixed Cartesian coordinate system being given, each vector is uniquely determined
by its ordered triple of corresponding components. Conversely, to each ordered
triple of real numbers (a , a , a ) there corresponds precisely one vector
1 2 3
a(cid:2)[a , a , a ],with(0, 0, 0) corresponding to thezero vector 0, which has length
1 2 3
0 and no direction.
Hence a vector equation a(cid:2)b is equivalent to the three equations a (cid:2)b ,
1 1
a (cid:2)b , a (cid:2)b for the components.
2 2 3 3
We now see that from our “geometric” definition of a vector as an arrow we have arrived
at an “algebraic” characterization of a vector by Theorem 1. We could have started from
the latter and reversed our process. This shows that the two approaches are equivalent.
Vector Addition, Scalar Multiplication
Calculations with vectors are very useful and are almost as simple as the arithmetic for
real numbers. Vector arithmetic follows almost naturally from applications. We first define
how to add vectors and later on how to multiply a vector by a number.
DEFINITION Addition of Vectors
The sum a(cid:4)b of two vectors a(cid:2)[a , a , a ] and b(cid:2)[b , b , b ] is obtained by
1 2 3 1 2 3
b adding the corresponding components,
a c = a + b (3) a(cid:4)b(cid:2)[a (cid:4)b , a (cid:4)b , a (cid:4)b ].

Fig. 170. Vector Geometrically, place the vectors as in Fig. 170 (the initial point of bat the terminal
addition point of a); then a(cid:4)bis the vector drawn from the initial point of ato the terminal
point of b.
For forces, this addition is the parallelogram law by which we obtain the resultantof two
forces in mechanics. See Fig. 171.
Figure 172 shows (for the plane) that the “algebraic” way and the “geometric way” of
vector addition give the same vector.

vectors. Instead of a(cid:4)a we also write 2a, and so on. This (and the notation (cid:3)a used
just before) motivates defining the second algebraic operation for vectors as follows.

Inner Product (Dot Product)
Orthogonality
The inner product or dot product can be motivated by calculating work done by a constant
force, determining components of forces, or other applications. It involves the length of
vectors and the angle between them. The inner product is a kind of multiplication of two
vectors, defined in such a way that the outcome is a scalar. Indeed, another term for inner
product is scalar product, a term we shall not use here. The definition of the inner product
is as follows.

The angle g, 0(cid:9)g(cid:9)p, between a and b is measured when the initial points of
the vectors coincide, as in Fig. 178. In components, a(cid:2)[a , a , a ], b (cid:2)[b , b , b ],

Orthogonality. Since the cosine in (1) may be positive, 0, or negative, so may be the
inner product (Fig. 178). The case that the inner product is zero is of particular practical
interest and suggests the following concept.
A vector a is called orthogonal to a vector b if a•b(cid:2)0. Then b is also orthogonal
to a, and we call a and b orthogonal vectors. Clearly, this happens for nonzero vectors
if and only if cos g (cid:2)0; thus g(cid:2)p 2 (90°). This proves the important

Using this and (3), you may prove (see Prob. 16)
(7) ƒa(cid:4)bƒ (cid:9) ƒaƒ (cid:4) ƒbƒ (Triangle inequality).
Geometrically, (7) with(cid:5) says that one side of a triangle must be shorter than the other
two sides together; this motivates the name of (7).

(8) ƒa(cid:4)bƒ2(cid:4) ƒa(cid:3)bƒ2(cid:2)2(ƒaƒ2(cid:4) ƒbƒ2) (Parallelogram equality).
Equations (6)–(8) play a basic role in so-called Hilbert spaces, which are abstract inner
product spaces. Hilbert spaces form the basis of quantum mechanics, for details see
[GenRef7] listed in App. 1.
Derivation of (2) from (1). We write a(cid:2)a i(cid:4)a j(cid:4)a kand b(cid:2)b i(cid:4) b j(cid:4)b k,
as in (8) of Sec. 9.1. If we substitute this into

Now i, j, k are unit vectors, so that i•i(cid:2)j•j(cid:2)k•k(cid:2)1by (3). Since the coordinate
axes are perpendicular, so are i, j, k, and Theorem 1 implies that the other six of those
nine products are 0, namely, i•j(cid:2)j•i(cid:2)j•k(cid:2)k•j(cid:2)k•i(cid:2)i•k(cid:2)0. But this
reduces our sum for a•b to (2). (cid:2)

Applications of Inner Products
Typical applications of inner products are shown in the following examples and in
Problem Set 9.2.
EXAMPLE 2 Work Done by a Force Expressed as an Inner Product
This is a major application. It concerns a body on which a constant force p acts. (For a variable force, see
Sec. 10.1.) Let the body be given a displacement d. Then the work done by pin the displacement is defined as
(9) W(cid:2) ƒpƒƒdƒ cos a(cid:2)p•d,
that is, magnitude ƒpƒ of the force times length ƒdƒ of the displacement times the cosine of the angle abetween
pand d(Fig. 179). If a(cid:5)90°, as in Fig. 179, then W(cid:6)0. If pand dare orthogonal, then the work is zero
(why?). If a(cid:6)90°, then W(cid:5)0, which means that in the displacement one has to do work against the force.
For example, think of swimming across a river at some angle aagainst the current.

EXAMPLE 3 Component of a Force in a Given Direction
What force in the rope in Fig. 180 will hold a car of 5000 lb in equilibrium if the ramp makes an angle of 25°
with the horizontal?
Solution. Introducing coordinates as shown, the weight is a(cid:2)[0, (cid:3)5000] because this force points
downward, in the negative y-direction. We have to represent aas a sum (resultant) of two forces, a(cid:2)c(cid:4)p,
where cis the force the car exerts on the ramp, which is of no interest to us, and pis parallel to the rope. A
vector in the direction of the rope is (see Fig. 180)
b(cid:2)[(cid:3)1, tan 25°](cid:2)[(cid:3)1, 0.46631], thus ƒbƒ (cid:2)1.10338,

EXAMPLE 4 Orthonormal Basis
By definition, an orthonormal basisfor 3-space is a basis {a, b, c}consisting of orthogonal unit vectors. It has
the great advantage that the determination of the coefficients in representations v(cid:2)l a(cid:4)l b(cid:4)l cof a given
1 2 3
vector vis very simple. We claim that l (cid:2)a•v, l (cid:2)b•v, l (cid:2)c•v. Indeed, this follows simply by taking
1 2 3
the inner products of the representation with a, b, c, respectively, and using the orthonormality of the basis,
a•v(cid:2)l a•a(cid:4)l a•b(cid:4)l a•c(cid:2)l , etc.

Now a normal vector of the given line x(cid:3)2y(cid:4)2(cid:2)0 is b(cid:2)[1, (cid:3)2]. Thus L is perpendicular to L
1 2
if b•a(cid:2)a (cid:3)2a (cid:2)0, for instance, if a(cid:2)[2, 1]. Hence L is given by 2x(cid:4)y(cid:2)c. It passes through

Vector Product (Cross Product)
We shall define another form of multiplication of vectors, inspired by applications, whose
result will be a vector. This is in contrast to the dot product of Sec. 9.2 where multiplication
resulted in a scalar. We can construct a vector v that is perpendicular to two vectors a
and b, which are two sides of a parallelogram on a plane in space as indicated in Fig.185,
such that the length ƒvƒ is numerically equal to the area of that parallelogram. Here then
is the new concept.
DEFINITION Vector Product (Cross Product, Outer Product) of Vectors
The vector product or cross product a(cid:2)b (read “a cross b”) of two vectors a
and b is the vector v denoted by
v(cid:2)a(cid:2)b
I. If a(cid:2)0 or b (cid:2)0, then we define v(cid:2)a(cid:2)b(cid:2)0.
II. If both vectors are nonzero vectors, then vector v has the length
(1) ƒvƒ (cid:2) ƒa(cid:2)bƒ (cid:2) ƒaƒƒbƒ sin g,
where g is the angle between a and b as in Sec. 9.2.
Furthermore, by design, a and b form the sides of a parallelogram on a plane
in space. The parallelogram is shaded in blue in Fig. 185. The area of this blue
parallelogram is precisely given by Eq. (1), so that the length ƒvƒ of the vector
v is equal to the area of that parallelogram.
III. If a and b lie in the same straight line, i.e., a and b have the same or opposite
directions, then g is 0° or 180° so that sin g (cid:2)0. In that case ƒvƒ (cid:2)0 so that
v(cid:2)a(cid:2)b(cid:2)0.
IV. If cases I and III do not occur, then v is a nonzero vector. The direction of
v(cid:2)a(cid:2)bis perpendicular to both a andb such that a, b, v—precisely in this
order (!)—form a right-handed triple as shown in Figs. 185–187 and explained
below.
Another term for vector product is outer product.
Remark. Note that I and III completely characterize the exceptional case when the cross
product is equal to the zero vector, and II and IV the regular case where the cross product
is perpendicular to two vectors.
Just as we did with the dot product, we would also like to express the cross product in
components. Let a(cid:2)[a , a , a ]and b(cid:2)[b , b , b ]. Then v(cid:2)[v , v , v ](cid:2)a(cid:2)bhas

Here the Cartesian coordinate system is right-handed, as explained below (see also
Fig. 188). (For a left-handed system, each component of v must be multiplied by (cid:3)1.

Right-Handed Triple. A triple of vectors a, b, v is right-handed if the vectors in the
given order assume the same sort of orientation as the thumb, index finger, and middle
finger of the right hand when these are held as in Fig. 186. We may also say that if a is
rotated into the direction of b through the angle g ((cid:5)p), then v advances in the same
direction as a right-handed screw would if turned in the same way (Fig. 187).

(7) a(cid:2)(b(cid:2)c)(cid:7)(a(cid:2)b)(cid:2)c

By (2*) the sum of the two determinants is the first component of (a(cid:2)b)(cid:4)(a(cid:2)c), the
right side of (5a). For the other compon2ents in (52 a)2and in 5(2b), equality follows by the
same idea.
Anticommutativity (6) follows from (2**) by noting that the interchange of Rows 2
and 3 multiplies the determinant by (cid:3)1. We can confirm this geometrically if we set
a(cid:2)b(cid:2)vand b(cid:2)a(cid:2)w; then ƒvƒ (cid:2) ƒwƒ by (1), and for b, a, wto form a right-handed
triple, we must have w(cid:2)(cid:3)v.
Finally, i(cid:2)(i (cid:2)j) (cid:2)i(cid:2)k(cid:2)(cid:3)j, whereas (i (cid:2)i) (cid:2)j(cid:2)0(cid:2)j(cid:2)0(see Example 2).
This proves (7). (cid:2)
Typical Applications of Vector Products
EXAMPLE 3 Moment of a Force
In mechanics the moment mof a force pabout a point Qis defined as the product m(cid:2) ƒpƒd, where dis the
(perpendicular) distance between Qand the line of action Lof p(Fig. 190). If ris the vector from Qto any
point Aon L, then d(cid:2) ƒrƒ sin g, as shown in Fig. 190, and
m(cid:2) ƒrƒƒpƒ sin g.
Since gis the angle between rand p, we see from (1) that m(cid:2) ƒr(cid:2)pƒ. The vector
(8) m(cid:2)r(cid:2)p
is called the moment vectoror vector momentof pabout Q. Its magnitude is m. If m(cid:7)0, its direction is
that of the axis of the rotation about Qthat phas the tendency to produce. This axis is perpendicular to both

p(cid:2)[1000 cos 30°, 1000 sin 30°, 0](cid:2)[866, 500, 0], r(cid:2)[0, 1.5, 0].
(Note that the center of the wheel is at y(cid:2)(cid:3)1.5on the y-axis.) Hence (8) and (2**) give

EXAMPLE 5 Velocity of a Rotating Body
A rotation of a rigid body B in space can be simply and uniquely described by a vector w as follows. The
direction of wis that of the axis of rotation and such that the rotation appears clockwise if one looks from the
initial point of wto its terminal point. The length of wis equal to the angular speedv((cid:6)0)of the rotation,
that is, the linear (or tangential) speed of a point of Bdivided by its distance from the axis of rotation.
Let Pbe any point of Band dits distance from the axis. Then Phas the speed vd. Let rbe the position vector
of Preferred to a coordinate system with origin 0 on the axis of rotation. Then d(cid:2) ƒrƒ sin g, where gis the
angle between wand r. Therefore,
vd(cid:2) ƒwƒƒrƒ sin g(cid:2) ƒw(cid:2)rƒ.
From this and the definition of vector product we see that the velocity vector vof Pcan be represented in the
form (Fig. 192)

Scalar Triple Product
Certain products of vectors, having three or more factors, occur in applications. The most
important of these products is the scalar triple product or mixed product of three vectors
a, b, c.
(10*) (a b c)(cid:2)a•(b(cid:2)c).
The scalar triple product is indeed a scalar since (10*) involves a dot product, which in
turn is a scalar. We want to express the scalar triple product in components and as a third-
order determinant. To this end, let a(cid:2)[a , a , a ], b (cid:2)[b , b , b ], and c(cid:2)[c , c , c ].
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
Also set b(cid:2)c(cid:2)v(cid:2)[v , v , v ]. Then from the dot product in components [formula
1 2 3
(2) in Sec. 9.2] and from (2*) with b and c instead of a and b we first obtain

THEOREM 2 Properties and Applications of Scalar Triple Products
(a) In (10) the dot and cross can be interchanged:
(11) (a b c)(cid:2)a•(b(cid:2)c)(cid:2)(a(cid:2)b)•c.
(b) Geometric interpretation. The absolute value ƒ(a b c)ƒ of (10) is the
volume of the parallelepiped (oblique box) with a, b, c as edge vectors (Fig. 193).
(c) Linear independence. Three vectors in R3 are linearly independent if
and only if their scalar triple product is not zero.
PROOF (a) Dot multiplication is commutative, so that by (10)

From this we obtain the determinant in (10) by interchanging Rows 1 and 2 and in the
result Rows 2 and 3. But this does not change the value of the determinant because each
interchange produces a factor (cid:3)1, and ((cid:3)1)((cid:3)1)(cid:2)1. This proves (11).
(b) The volume of that box equals the height h(cid:2) ƒaƒƒcos gƒ (Fig. 193) times the area
of the base, which is the area ƒb(cid:2)cƒ of the parallelogram with sides band c. Hence the
volume is
ƒaƒƒb(cid:2)cƒ ƒcos gƒ (cid:2) ƒa•(b(cid:2)c)ƒ (Fig. 193)
as given by the absolute value of (11).
(c)Three nonzero vectors, whose initial points coincide, are linearly independent if and
only if the vectors do not lie in the same plane nor lie on the same straight line.
This happens if and only if the triple product in (b) is not zero, so that the independence
criterion follows. (The case of one of the vectors being the zero vector is trivial.)

Vector and Scalar Functions and Their Fields.
Vector Calculus: Derivatives
Our discussion of vector calculus begins with identifying the two types of functions on which
it operates. Let P be any point in a domain of definition. Typical domains in applications
are three-dimensional, or a surface or a curve in space. Then we define a vector function
v,whose values are vectors, that is,
v(cid:2)v(P)(cid:2)[v (P), v (P), v (P)]
1 2 3
c09.qxd 10/30/10 3:25 PM Page 376
376 CHAP. 9 Vector Differential Calculus. Grad, Div, Curl
that depends on points Pin space. We say that a vector function defines a vector fieldin
a domain of definition. Typical domains were just mentioned. Examples of vector fields
are the field of tangent vectors of a curve (shown in Fig. 195), normal vectors of a surface
(Fig. 196), and velocity field of a rotating body (Fig. 197). Note that vector functions may
also depend on time t or on some other parameters.
Similarly, we define a scalar function f, whose values are scalars, that is,
f(cid:2)f(P)
that depends on P. We say that a scalar function defines a scalar field in that three-
dimensional domain or surface or curve in space. Two representative examples of scalar
fields are the temperature field of a body and the pressure field of the air in Earth’s
atmosphere. Note that scalar functions may also depend on some parameter such as
time t.
Notation. If we introduce Cartesian coordinates x, y, z, then, instead of writing v(P) for
the vector function, we can write
v(x, y, z)(cid:2)[v (x, y, z), v (x, y, z), v (x, y, z)].
1 2 3
Fig. 195. Field of tangent Fig. 196. Field of normal
vectors of a curve vectors of a surface
We have to keep in mind that the components depend on our choice of coordinate system,
whereas a vector field that has a physical or geometric meaning should have magnitude
and direction depending only on P, not on the choice of coordinate system.
Similarly, for a scalar function, we write
f(P)(cid:2)f(x, y, z).
We illustrate our discussion of vector functions, scalar functions, vector fields, and scalar
fields by the following three examples.
EXAMPLE 1 Scalar Function (Euclidean Distance in Space)
The distance f(P) of any point Pfrom a fixed point P in space is a scalar function whose domain of definition
0
is the whole space. f(P) defines a scalar field in space. If we introduce a Cartesian coordinate system and P
0
has the coordinates x , y , z , then fis given by the well-known formula
0 0 0
f(P)(cid:2)f(x, y, z)(cid:2) 2(x(cid:3)x )2(cid:4)(y(cid:3)y )2(cid:4)(z(cid:3)z )2
0 0 0
where x, y, zare the coordinates of P. If we replace the given Cartesian coordinate system with another such
system by translating and rotating the given system, then the values of the coordinates of Pand P will in general
0
change, but f(P)will have the same value as before. Hence f(P)is a scalar function. The direction cosines of
the straight line through Pand P are not scalars because their values depend on the choice of the coordinate
0 (cid:2)
system.

EXAMPLE 2 Vector Field (Velocity Field)
At any instant the velocity vectors v(P) of a rotating body Bconstitute a vector field, called the velocity field
of the rotation. If we introduce a Cartesian coordinate system having the origin on the axis of rotation, then (see

Vector Calculus
The student may be pleased to learn that many of the concepts covered in (regular)
calculus carry over to vector calculus. Indeed, we show how the basic concepts of
convergence, continuity, and differentiability from calculus can be defined for vector
functions in a simple and natural way. Most important of these is the derivative of a
vector function.
Convergence. An infinite sequence of vectors a , n(cid:2)1, 2,Á , is said to converge if
(n)
there is a vector a such that
(4) lim ƒa (cid:3)aƒ (cid:2)0.
n:(cid:12) (n)
a is called the limit vector of that sequence, and we write
(5) lim a (cid:2)a.
n:(cid:12) (n)
If the vectors are given in Cartesian coordinates, then this sequence of vectors converges
to a if and only if the three sequences of components of the vectors converge to the
corresponding components of a. We leave the simple proof to the student.
Similarly, a vector function v(t) of a real variable t is said to have the limit l as t
approaches t , if v(t) is defined in some neighborhood of t (possibly except at t ) and
0 0 0
(6) lim ƒv(t)(cid:3)lƒ (cid:2)0.
t:t0
Then we write
(7) lim v(t)(cid:2)l.
t:t0
Here, a neighborhoodof t is an interval (segment) on the t-axis containing t as an interior
0 0
point (not as an endpoint).
Continuity. A vector function v(t) is said to be continuous at t(cid:2)t if it is defined in
0
some neighborhood of t (including at t itself!) and
0 0
(8) lim v(t)(cid:2)v(t ).
t:t0 0
c09.qxd 10/30/10 3:25 PM Page 379
SEC. 9.4 Vector and Scalar Functions and Their Fields. Vector Calculus: Derivatives 379
If we introduce a Cartesian coordinate system, we may write
v(t)(cid:2)[v (t), v (t), v (t)](cid:2)v (t)i(cid:4)v (t)j(cid:4)v (t)k.
1 2 3 1 2 3
Then v(t) is continuous at t if and only if its three components are continuous at t .

We now state the most important of these definitions.
DEFINITION Derivative of a Vector Function
A vector function v(t) is said to be differentiableat a pointt if the following limit
exists:
v(t (cid:4) ¢t) (cid:3)v(t)
(9) vr (t)(cid:2) lim .
¢t:0 ¢t
r
This vector v (t) is called the derivative of v(t). See Fig. 199.

In components with respect to a given Cartesian coordinate system,
(10)
vr (t)(cid:2)[vr

1 2 3
r
Hence the derivativev (t)is obtained by differentiating each component separately.For
instance, if v(cid:2)[t, t2, 0], then vr (cid:2)[1, 2t, 0].
Equation (10) follows from (9) and conversely because (9) is a “vector form” of the
usual formula of calculus by which the derivative of a function of a single variable is
defined. [The curve in Fig. 199 is the locus of the terminal points representing v(t) for
values of the independent variable in some interval containing t and t(cid:4) ¢t in (9)]. It
follows that the familiar differentiation rules continue to hold for differentiating vector
functions, for instance,
(cv)r (cid:2)cvr
(c constant),
(u(cid:4)v)r (cid:2)ur(cid:4)vr
and in particular
(11)
(u•v)r (cid:2)ur •v(cid:4)u•vr
(12)
(u(cid:2)v)r (cid:2)ur (cid:2)v(cid:4)u(cid:2)vr
(13) (u v w)r (cid:2)(ur v w)(cid:4)(u vr w)(cid:4)(u v wr ).
c09.qxd 10/30/10 3:25 PM Page 380
380 CHAP. 9 Vector Differential Calculus. Grad, Div, Curl
The simple proofs are left to the student. In (12), note the order of the vectors carefully
because cross multiplication is not commutative.
EXAMPLE 4 Derivative of a Vector Function of Constant Length
Let v(t) be a vector function whose length is constant, say, ƒv(t)ƒ (cid:2)c. Then ƒvƒ2(cid:2)v•v(cid:2)c2, and
(v•v)r(cid:2)2v•vr(cid:2)0,
by differentiation [see (11)]. This yields the following result. The derivative of a vector
(cid:2)
functionv(t) of constant length is either the zero vector or is perpendicular tov(t).
Partial Derivatives of a Vector Function
Our present discussion shows that partial differentiation of vector functions of two or more
variables can be introduced as follows. Suppose that the components of a vector function
v(cid:2)[v , v , v ](cid:2)v i(cid:4)v j(cid:4)v k
1 2 3 1 2 3
Á
are differentiable functions of nvariables t , , t . Then the partial derivativeof vwith
1 n
respect to t is denoted by 0v 0t and is defined as the vector function
m > m
0v 0v 0v 0v
(cid:2) 1 i(cid:4) 2 j(cid:4) 3 k.
0t 0t 0t 0t

Similarly, second partial derivatives are
02v 02v 02v 02v

0t 0t 0t 0t 0t 0t 0t 0t

and so on.

Curves. Arc Length. Curvature. Torsion
Vector calculus has important applications to curves (Sec. 9.5) and surfaces (to be covered
in Sec. 10.5) in physics and geometry. The application of vector calculus to geometry is
a field known as differential geometry. Differential geometric methods are applied
to problems in mechanics, computer-aided as well as traditional engineering design,
geodesy, geography, space travel, and relativity theory. For details, see [GenRef8] and
[GenRef9] in App. 1.
Bodies that move in space form paths that may be represented by curves C. This and
other applications show the need for parametric representationsof Cwith parametert,
which may denote time or something else (see Fig. 200). A typical parametric representation
is given by
(1) r(t)(cid:2) [x(t), y(t), z (t)] (cid:2)x(t)i(cid:4)y(t)j(cid:4)z(t)k.

Fig. 200. Parametric representation of a curve
Here tis the parameter and x, y, zare Cartesian coordinates, that is, the usual rectangular
coordinates as shown in Sec. 9.1. To each value t(cid:2)t , there corresponds a point of C
0
with position vector r(t ) whose coordinates are x(t ), y(t ), z(t ). This is illustrated
˛ 0 0 0 0
in Figs. 201 and 202.
The use of parametric representations has key advantages over other representations
that involve projections into the xy-plane and xz-plane or involve a pair of equations with
y or with z as independent variable. The projections look like this:
(2) y(cid:2)f(x), z(cid:2)g(x).
c09.qxd 10/30/10 3:25 PM Page 382
382 CHAP. 9 Vector Differential Calculus. Grad, Div, Curl
The advantages of using (1) instead of (2) are that, in (1), the coordinates x, y, z all
play an equal role, that is, all three coordinates are dependent variables. Moreover, the
parametric representation (1) induces an orientation on C. This means that as we
increase t, we travel along the curve C in a certain direction. The sense of increasing
tis called the positive sense on C. The sense of decreasing tis then called the negative
sense on C, given by (1).
Examples 1–4 give parametric representations of several important curves.
EXAMPLE 1 Circle. Parametric Representation. Positive Sense
The circle x2(cid:4)y2(cid:2)4, z(cid:2)0in the xy-plane with center 0 and radius 2 can be represented parametrically by
r(t)(cid:2)[2 cos t, 2 sin t, 0] or simply by r(t)(cid:2)[2 cos t, 2 sin t] (Fig. 201)
where 0(cid:9)t(cid:9)2p. Indeed, x2(cid:4)y2(cid:2)(2 cos t)2(cid:4)(2 sin t)2(cid:2)4(cos2 t(cid:4)sin2 t)(cid:2)4, For t(cid:2)0 we have
r(0)(cid:2)[2, 0], for t(cid:2)1pwe get r(1p)(cid:2)[0, 2],and so on. The positive sense induced by this representation
2 2
is the counterclockwise sense.
If we replace twith t*(cid:2)(cid:3)t,we have t(cid:2)(cid:3)t*and get
r*(t*)(cid:2)[2 cos ((cid:3)t*), 2 sin ((cid:3)t*)](cid:2)[2 cos t*, (cid:3)2 sin t*].
(cid:2)
This has reversed the orientation, and the circle is now oriented clockwise.
EXAMPLE 2 Ellipse

(3) r(t)(cid:2)[a cos t, b sin t, 0](cid:2)a cos t i(cid:4)b sin t j (Fig. 202)

y-axes. In fact, since cos2 t(cid:4)sin2 t(cid:2)1, we obtain from (3)

(5) r(t)(cid:2)[a cos t, a sin t, ct](cid:2)a cos ti(cid:4)a sin tj(cid:4)ctk (c(cid:7)0)
is called a circular helix.It lies on the cylinder x2(cid:4)y2(cid:2)a2. If c(cid:6)0,the helix is shaped like a right-handed
screw (Fig. 204). If c(cid:5)0,it looks like a left-handed screw (Fig. 205). If c(cid:2)0,then (5) is a circle. (cid:2)

A simple curve is a curve without multiple points, that is, without points at which the
curve intersects or touches itself. Circle and helix are simple curves. Figure 206 shows
curves that are not simple. An example is [sin 2t, cos t, 0]. Can you sketch it?
An arc of a curve is the portion between any two points of the curve. For simplicity,
we say “curve” for curves as well as for arcs.

Tangent to a Curve
The next idea is the approximation of a curve by straight lines, leading to tangents and
to a definition of length. Tangents are straight lines touching a curve. The tangent to a
simple curve C at a point P of C is the limiting position of a straight line L through P
and a point Q of C as Q approaches P along C. See Fig. 207.
Let us formalize this concept. If C is given by r(t), and P and Q correspond to t and
t(cid:4) ¢t, then a vector in the direction of L is
1
[r(t (cid:4) ¢t) (cid:3)r(t)].
(6) ¢t
In the limit this vector becomes the derivative
(7) rr (t)(cid:2) lim 1 [r(t (cid:4) ¢t) (cid:3)r(t)],
¢t:0 ¢t
provided r(t) is differentiable, as we shall assume from now on. If rr (t)(cid:7)0,we call rr (t)
a tangent vectorof Cat Pbecause it has the direction of the tangent. The corresponding
unit vector is the unit tangent vector (see Fig. 207)
(8) u(cid:2) 1 rr .
ƒrrƒ
r
Note that both r and u point in the direction of increasing t. Hence their sense depends
on the orientation of C. It is reversed if we reverse the orientation.
It is now easy to see that the tangent to C at P is given by
(9)
q(w)(cid:2)r(cid:4)wrr
(Fig. 208).

This is the sum of the position vector rof Pand a multiple of the tangent vector r of C

Solution. Equation (3) with semi-axes a(cid:2)2and b(cid:2)1gives r(t)(cid:2)[2 cos t, sin t].The derivative is

To check the result, sketch or graph the ellipse and the tangent.
Length of a Curve
We are now ready to define the length l of a curve. l will be the limit of the lengths of
broken lines of n chords (see Fig. 209, where n(cid:2)5) with larger and larger n. For this,
let r(t), a (cid:9)t(cid:9)b, represent C. For each n(cid:2)1, 2,Á , we subdivide (“partition”) the
interval a(cid:9)t(cid:9)b by points
t ((cid:2)a), t ,Á , t , t ((cid:2)b), where t (cid:5)t (cid:5) Á (cid:5)t .

This gives a broken line of chords with endpoints r(t ), , r(t ).We do this arbitrarily

but so that the greatest ƒ¢t ƒ (cid:2) ƒt (cid:3)t ƒ approaches 0 as n:(cid:12). The lengths
m m m(cid:3)1

l , l , of these chords can be obtained from the Pythagorean theorem. If r(t) has a
1 2
r Á
continuous derivative r (t),it can be shown that the sequence l , l , has a limit, which
1 2
is independent of the particular choice of the representation of C and of the choice of
subdivisions. This limit is given by the integral
(cid:2)b
(10) l(cid:2) 2rr •rr dt rr (cid:2) dr .
a dtb
a
l is called the length of C, and C is called rectifiable. Formula (10) is made plausible
incalculus for plane curves and is proved for curves in space in [GenRef8] listed in App.1.
The actual evaluation of the integral (10) will, in general, be difficult. However, some
simple cases are given in the problem set.
Arc Length s of a Curve
The length (10) of a curve Cis a constant, a positive number. But if we replace the fixed
bin (10) with a variable t, the integral becomes a function of t, denoted by s(t) and called
the arc length function or simply the arc length of C. Thus

Here the variable of integration is denoted by t because tis now used in the upper limit.
Geometrically, s(t )with some t (cid:6)ais the length of the arc of Cbetween the points

with parametric values a and t . The choice of a (the point s(cid:2)0) is arbitrary; changing
0
a means changing s by a constant.

ds is called the linear element of C.
Arc Length as Parameter. The use of sin (1) instead of an arbitrary tsimplifies various
formulas. For the unit tangent vector (8) we simply obtain
(14)
u(s)(cid:2)rr
(s).
Indeed, ƒrr (s)ƒ (cid:2)(ds ds) (cid:2)1 in (12) shows that rr (s) is a unit vector. Even greater

simplifications due to the use of s will occur in curvature and torsion (below).
EXAMPLE 6 Circular Helix. Circle. Arc Length as Parameter
The helix r(t)(cid:2)[a cos t, a sin t, ct] in (5) has the derivative rr (t)(cid:2)[(cid:3)a sin t, a cos t, c]. Hence
rr•rr(cid:2)a2(cid:4)c2,a constant, which we denote by K2.Hence the integrand in (11) is constant, equal to K,
and the integral is s(cid:2)Kt. Thus t(cid:2)s K, so that a representation of the helix with the arc length s as

Curves in Mechanics. Velocity. Acceleration
Curves play a basic role in mechanics, where they may serve as paths of moving bodies.
Then such a curve Cshould be represented by a parametric representation r(t) with time
t as parameter. The tangent vector (7) of C is then called the velocity vector v because,
being tangent, it points in the instantaneous direction of motion and its length gives the
speed ƒvƒ (cid:2) ƒrrƒ (cid:2) 2rr •rr (cid:2)ds dt; see (12). The second derivative of r(t) is called
>
the acceleration vector and is denoted by a. Its length ƒaƒ is called the acceleration of
the motion. Thus
(16)
v(t)(cid:2)rr
(t),
a(t)(cid:2)vr (t)(cid:2)rs
(t).
c09.qxd 10/30/10 3:25 PM Page 387
SEC. 9.5 Curves. Arc Length. Curvature. Torsion 387
Tangential and Normal Acceleration. Whereas the velocity vector is always tangent
to the path of motion, the acceleration vector will generally have another direction. We
can split the acceleration vector into two directional components, that is,
(17) a(cid:2)a (cid:4)a ,
tan norm
where the tangential acceleration vector a is tangent to the path (or, sometimes, 0)
tan
and the normal acceleration vector a is normal (perpendicular) to the path (or,
norm
sometimes, 0).
Expressions for the vectors in (17) are obtained from (16) by the chain rule. We first have
dr dr ds ds
v(t)(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)u(s)
dt ds dt dt
where u(s) is the unit tangent vector (14). Another differentiation gives
2
dv d ds du ds d2s
(18) a(t)(cid:2) (cid:2) u(s) (cid:2) (cid:4)u(s) .
dt dt a dt b ds adt b dt2
Since the tangent vector u(s) has constant length (length one), its derivative du ds is
>
perpendicular to u(s), from the result in Example 4 in Sec. 9.4. Hence the first term on
the right of (18) is the normal acceleration vector, and the second term on the right is the
tangential acceleration vector, so that (18) is of the form (17).
Now the length ƒa ƒ is the absolute value of the projection of ain the direction of v,
tan
given by (11) in Sec. 9.2 with b(cid:2)v; that is, ƒa ƒ (cid:2) ƒa•vƒ ƒvƒ. Hence a is this
tan > tan
expression times the unit vector (1 ƒvƒ)v in the direction of v, that is,
>
a•v
(18*) a tan (cid:2) v•v v. Also, a norm(cid:2)a(cid:3)a tan.
We now turn to two examples that are relevant to applications in space travel.
They deal with the centripetal and centrifugal accelerations, as well as the Coriolis
acceleration.
EXAMPLE 7 Centripetal Acceleration. Centrifugal Force
The vector function
r(t)(cid:2)[R cos vt, R sin vt](cid:2)R cos vt i(cid:4)R sin vt j (Fig. 210)
(with fixed iand j) represents a circle Cof radius Rwith center at the origin of the xy-plane and describes the
motion of a small body Bcounterclockwise around the circle. Differentiation gives the velocity vector
v(cid:2)rr(cid:2)[(cid:3)Rv sin vt, Rv cos vt](cid:2)(cid:3)Rv sin vt i(cid:4)Rv cos vt j (Fig. 210)
vis tangent to C. Its magnitude, the speed, is
ƒvƒ (cid:2) ƒrrƒ (cid:2) 2rr•rr(cid:2)Rv.
Hence it is constant. The speed divided by the distance Rfrom the center is called the angular speed. It equals
v, so that it is constant, too. Differentiating the velocity vector, we obtain the acceleration vector
(19) a(cid:2)vr(cid:2)[(cid:3)Rv2 cos vt, (cid:3)Rv2 sin vt](cid:2)(cid:3)Rv2 cos vt i(cid:3)Rv2 sin vt j.

This shows that a(cid:2)(cid:3)v2r(Fig. 210), so that there is an acceleration toward the center, called the centripetal

magnitude is constant, ƒaƒ (cid:2)v2ƒrƒ (cid:2)v2R.Multiplying aby the mass mof B, we get the centripetal forcema.
The opposite vector (cid:3)mais called the centrifugal force. At each instant these two forces are in equilibrium.
We see that in this motion the acceleration vector is normal (perpendicular) to C; hence there is no tangential
(cid:2)
acceleration.

(see Example 7). Since bis rotating together with the Earth, it is of the form
b(t)(cid:2)cos vt i(cid:4)sin vt j.
Let the projectile be moving on the meridian whose plane is spanned by band k(Fig. 211) with constant angular

We have finished setting up the model. Next, we apply vector calculus to obtain the desired acceleration of the
projectile. Our result will be unexpected—and highly relevant for air and space travel. The first and second
derivatives of bwith respect to tare

(cid:2)R cos gt bs(cid:3)2gR sin gt br(cid:3)g2r.
By analogy with Example 7 and because of bs(cid:2)(cid:3)v2bin (20) we conclude that the first term in a(involving v
s
in b !) is the centripetal acceleration due to the rotation of the Earth. Similarly, the third term in the last line (involving
g!) is the centripetal acceleration due to the motion of the projectile on the meridian Mof the rotating Earth.
The second, unexpected term (cid:3)2gR sin gt br in a is called the Coriolis acceleration3(Fig. 211) and is
due to the interaction of the two rotations. On the Northern Hemisphere, sin gt(cid:6)0(for t(cid:6)0;also g(cid:6)0
by assumption), so that a has the direction of (cid:3)br , that is, opposite to the rotation of the Earth. ƒa ƒ

Hemisphere, where sin gt(cid:5)0, to the left). This deviation has been observed for missiles, rockets, shells,
(cid:2)
and atmospheric airflow.
Curvature and Torsion. Optional
This last topic of Sec. 9.5 is optional but completes our discussion of curves relevant to
vector calculus.
The curvature(cid:2)(s)of a curve C:r(s)(sthe arc length) at a point Pof Cmeasures the
rate of change ƒur (s)ƒ of the unit tangent vector u(s)at P. Hence (cid:2)(s)measures the deviation
of C at P from a straight line (its tangent at P). Since
u(s)(cid:2)rr
(s), the definition is
(22) (cid:2)(s)(cid:2) ƒur (s)ƒ (cid:2) ƒrs (s)ƒ (r (cid:2)d ds).
>
The torsion t(s) of C at P measures the rate of change of the osculating plane O of
r
curve C at point P. Note that this plane is spanned by u and u and shown in Fig. 212.
Hence t(s) measures the deviation of C at P from a plane (from O at P). Now the rate
r
of change is also measured by the derivative b of a normal vector bat O. By the definition
of vector product, a unit normal vector of Ois b(cid:2)u(cid:2)(1 (cid:2))ur (cid:2)u(cid:2)p.Here p(cid:2)(1 (cid:2))ur
> >
is called the unit principal normal vectorand bis called the unit binormal vectorofC
at P.The vectors are labeled in Fig. 212. Here we must assume that (cid:2)(cid:7)0; hence (cid:2)(cid:6)0.
The absolute value of the torsion is now defined by
(23*) ƒt(s)ƒ (cid:2) ƒbr (s)ƒ.
Whereas (cid:2)(s) is nonnegative, it is practical to give the torsion a sign, motivated by
“right-handed” and “left-handed” (see Figs. 204 and 205). This needs a little further
r
calculation. Since b is a unit vector, it has constant length. Hence b is perpendicular

to b (see Example 4 in Sec. 9.4). Now b is also perpendicular to u because, by the
definition of vector product, we have b•u(cid:2)0, b•ur (cid:2)0. This implies
(b•u)r (cid:2)0; that is, br •u(cid:4)b•ur (cid:2)br •u(cid:4)0(cid:2)0.
Hence if br (cid:7)0at P, it must have the direction of por (cid:3)p, so that it must be of the form
br (cid:2)(cid:3)tp. Taking the dot product of this by p and using p•p(cid:2)1 gives
(23)
t(s)(cid:2)(cid:3)p(s)•br
(s).
The minus sign is chosen to make the torsion of a right-handedhelix positiveand that of
a left-handedhelix negative(Figs. 204 and 205). The orthonormal vector triple u,p,bis
called the trihedron of C. Figure 212 also shows the names of the three straight lines in
the directions of u,p,b, which are the intersections of the osculating plane, the normal
plane, and the rectifying plane.

Calculus Review:
Functions of Several Variables. Optional
The parametric representations of curves C required vector functions that depended on a
single variable x, s, or t.We now want to systematically cover vector functions of several
variables.This optional section is inserted into the book for your convenience and to make
the book reasonably self-contained. Go onto Sec. 9.7 and consult Sec. 9.6 only when
needed. For partial derivatives, see App. A3.2.

THEOREM 1 Chain Rule
Let w(cid:2)f(x, y, z) be continuous and have continuous first partial derivatives in a
domain D in xyz-space. Let x(cid:2)x(u, v), y(cid:2)y(u, v), z(cid:2)z(u, v) be functions that
are continuous and have first partial derivatives in a domain B in the uv-plane,
where B is such that for every point (u, v) in B, the corresponding point [x(u, v),
y(u, v), z(u, v)] lies in D. See Fig. 213. Then the function
w(cid:2)f(x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v))
is defined in B, has first partial derivatives with respect to u and v in B, and

In this theorem, a domain D is an open connected point set in xyz-space, where
“connected” means that any two points of D can be joined by a broken line of finitely
many linear segments all of whose points belong to D. “Open” means that every point P
of Dhas a neighborhood (a little ball with center P) all of whose points belong to D. For
example, the interior of a cube or of an ellipsoid (the solid without the boundary surface)
is a domain.
In calculus, x, y, z are often called the intermediate variables, in contrast with the
independent variables u, v and the dependent variable w.

Gradient of a Scalar Field.
Directional Derivative
We shall see that someof the vector fields that occur in applications—not all of them!—
can be obtained from scalar fields. Using scalar fields instead of vector fields is of a
considerable advantage because scalar fields are easier to use than vector fields. It is the
c09.qxd 10/30/10 3:25 PM Page 396
396 CHAP. 9 Vector Differential Calculus. Grad, Div, Curl
“gradient” that allows us to obtain vector fields from scalar fields, and thus the gradient
is of great practical importance to the engineer.
DEFINITION 1 Gradient
The setting is that we are given a scalar function f(x, y, z) that is defined and
differentiable in a domain in 3-space with Cartesian coordinates x, y, z. We denote
the gradient of that function by grad f or (cid:14)f (read nabla f). Then the qradient of
f(x, y, z) is defined as the vector function
0f 0f 0f 0f 0f 0f
(1) grad f(cid:2)(cid:14)f(cid:2) , , (cid:2) i(cid:4) j(cid:4) k.
c0x 0y 0zd 0x 0y 0z
Remarks. For a definition of the gradient in curvilinear coordinates, see App. 3.4.
As a quick example, if f(x, y, z)(cid:2)2y3(cid:4)4xz(cid:4)3x, then grad f(cid:2)[4z (cid:4)3, 6y2, 4x].
Furthermore, we will show later in this section that (1) actually does define a vector.
The notation (cid:14)f is suggested by the differential operator (cid:14) (read nabla) defined by
0 0 0
(1*) (cid:14)(cid:2) i(cid:4) j(cid:4) k.
0x 0y 0z
Gradients are useful in several ways, notably in giving the rate of change of f(x, y, z)
in any direction in space, in obtaining surface normal vectors, and in deriving vector fields
from scalar fields, as we are going to show in this section.
Directional Derivative
From calculus we know that the partial derivatives in (1) give the rates of change of
f(x, y, z)in the directions of the three coordinate axes. It seems natural to extend this and
ask for the rate of change of fin an arbitrary directionin space. This leads to the following
concept.
DEFINITION 2 Directional Derivative
The directional derivative D f or df ds of a function f(x, y, z) at a point P in the
b >
direction of a vector b is defined by (see Fig. 215)
df f(Q)(cid:3)f(P)
(2) D f(cid:2) (cid:2)lim .
b ds s:0 s
HereQ is a variable point on the straight lineL in the direction of b,and ƒsƒ is the
distance betweenP andQ. Also, s(cid:6)0ifQ lies in the direction of b(as in Fig.215),
s(cid:5)0 if Q lies in the direction of (cid:3)b, and s(cid:2)0 if Q(cid:2)P.

The next idea is to use Cartesian xyz-coordinates and for ba unit vector. Then the line L

where p the position vector of P. Equation (2) now shows that D f(cid:2)df ds is the
0 b >
derivative of the function f(x(s), y(s), z(s)) with respect to the arc length s of L. Hence,
assuming that f has continuous partial derivatives and applying the chain rule [formula
(3) in the previous section], we obtain
df 0f 0f 0f
(4) D f(cid:2) (cid:2) xr (cid:4) yr (cid:4) zr

where primes denote derivatives with respect to s (which are taken at s(cid:2)0). But here,
differentiating (3) gives rr (cid:2)xr i(cid:4)yr j(cid:4)zr k(cid:2)b. Hence (4) is simply the inner product

Gradient Is a Vector. Maximum Increase
Here is a finer point of mathematics that concerns the consistency of our theory: grad f
in (1) lookslike a vector—after all, it has three components! But to prove that it actually
is a vector, since it is defined in terms of components depending on the Cartesian
coordinates, we must show that grad f has a length and direction independent of the choice
of those coordinates. See proof of Theorem 1. In contrast, [0f 0x, 20f 0y, 0f 0z]also looks
> > >
like a vector but does not have a length and direction independent of the choice of Cartesian
coordinates.
Incidentally, the direction makes the gradient eminently useful: grad f points in the
direction of maximum increase of f.
THEOREM 1 Use of Gradient: Direction of Maximum Increase
Let f(P)(cid:2)f(x, y, z)be a scalar function having continuous first partial derivatives
in some domain B in space. Then gradfexists in B and is a vector, that is, its length
and direction are independent of the particular choice of Cartesian coordinates. If
grad f(P)(cid:7)0 at some point P, it has the direction of maximum increase of f at P.
PROOF From (5) and the definition of inner product [(1) in Sec. 9.2] we have
(6) D f(cid:2) ƒbƒƒgrad fƒ cos g (cid:2) ƒgrad fƒ cos g
b
where gis the angle between band grad f. Now fis a scalar function. Hence its value at
a point P depends on P but not on the particular choice of coordinates. The same holds
for the arc length sof the line Lin Fig. 215, hence also for D f. Now (6) shows that D f
is maximum when cos g (cid:2)1, g(cid:2)0, and then D f(cid:2) ƒgrad
fb
ƒ. It follows that the
lengb
th
b
and direction of grad f are independent of the choice of coordinates. Since g(cid:2)0 if and
only if b has the direction of grad f, the latter is the direction of maximum increase of f
at P, provided grad f(cid:7)0 at P. Make sure that you understood the proof to get a good
feel for mathematics.
Gradient as Surface Normal Vector
Gradients have an important application in connection with surfaces, namely, as surface
normal vectors, as follows. Let Sbe a surface represented by f(x, y, z)(cid:2)c(cid:2)const,where
fis differentiable. Such a surface is called a level surfaceof f, and for different cwe get
different level surfaces. Now let C be a curve on S through a point P of S. As a curve in
space, C has a representation r(t)(cid:2)[x(t), y(t), z(t)]. For C to lie on the surface S, the
components of r(t) must satisfy f(x, y, z)(cid:2)c, that is,
(7) f(x(t), y(t), z(t)(cid:2)c.
Now a tangent vector of C is
rr (t)(cid:2)[xr
(t),
yr
(t),
zr
(t)]. And the tangent vectors of all
curves on Spassing through Pwill generally form a plane, called the tangent planeof S
at P. (Exceptions occur at edges or cusps of S, for instance, at the apex of the cone in
Fig. 217.) The normal of this plane (the straight line through Pperpendicular to the tangent
plane) is called the surface normal to S at P. A vector in the direction of the surface

normal is called a surface normal vector of S at P. We can obtain such a vector quite
simply by differentiating (7) with respect to t. By the chain rule,

Let fbe a differentiable scalar function in space. Let f(x, y, z)(cid:2)c(cid:2)constrepresent

normal vector of S at P.

Vector Fields That Are Gradients
of Scalar Fields (“Potentials”)
At the beginning of this section we mentioned that some vector fields have the advantage
that they can be obtained from scalar fields, which can be worked with more easily. Such
a vector field is given by a vector function v(P), which is obtained as the gradient of a
scalar function, say, v(P)(cid:2)grad f(P). The function f(P)is called a potential function or
a potentialof v(P). Such a v(P)and the corresponding vector field are called conservative
because in such a vector field, energy is conserved; that is, no energy is lost (or gained)
in displacing a body (or a charge in the case of an electrical field) from a point Pto another
point in the field and back to P. We show this in Sec. 10.2.
Conservative fields play a central role in physics and engineering. A basic application
concerns the gravitational force (see Example 3 in Sec. 9.4) and we show that it has a
potential which satisfies Laplace’s equation, the most important partial differential
equation in physics and its applications.

The great importance of the Laplace equation also results from the fact that there are
other laws in physics that are of the same form as Newton’s law of gravitation. For instance,

Divergence of a Vector Field
Vector calculus owes much of its importance in engineering and physics to the gradient,
divergence, and curl. From a scalar field we can obtain a vector field by the gradient
(Sec.9.7). Conversely, from a vector field we can obtain a scalar field by the divergence
or another vector field by the curl (to be discussed in Sec. 9.9). These concepts were
suggested by basic physical applications. This will be evident from our examples.
To begin, let v(x, y, z) be a differentiable vector function, where x, y, z are Cartesian
coordinates, and let v , v , v be the components of v. Then the function

SEC. 9.8 Divergence of a Vector Field 403
is called the divergence of v or the divergence of the vector field defined by v. For
example, if
v(cid:2)[3xz, 2xy, (cid:3)yz2](cid:2)3xzi (cid:4)2xyj(cid:3)yz2k, then div v(cid:2)3z(cid:4)2x(cid:3)2yz.

derivative 0v 0x, etc. This is a convenient > nota t˛ io1 n, but nothing more. Note that (cid:5)•v
1>
means the scalar div v, whereas (cid:14)f means the vector grad f defined in Sec. 9.7.
In Example 2 we shall see that the divergence has an important physical meaning.
Clearly, the values of a function that characterizes a physical or geometric property must
be independent of the particular choice of coordinates. In other words, these values must
be invariant with respect to coordinate transformations. Accordingly, the following
theorem should hold.
THEOREM 1 Invariance of the Divergence
The divergence div v is a scalar function, that is, its values depend only on the
points in space (and, of course, on v) but not on the choice of the coordinates in
(1), so that with respect to other Cartesian coordinates x*, y*, z*and corresponding
components v *, v *, v * of v,

0v* 0v* 0v*
(2) div v (cid:2) 1 (cid:4) 2 (cid:4) 3 .
0x* 0y* 0z*
We shall prove this theorem in Sec. 10.7, using integrals.
Presently, let us turn to the more immediate practical task of gaining a feel for the
significance of the divergence. Let f(x, y, z)be a twice differentiable scalar function. Then
its gradient exists,
0f 0f 0f 0f 0f 0f
v(cid:2)grad f(cid:2) , , (cid:2) i(cid:4) j(cid:4) k
c0x 0y 0z d 0x 0y 0z
and we can differentiate once more, the first component with respect to x, the second with
respect to y, the third with respect to z, and then form the divergence,

div v (cid:2)div (grad f)(cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:4) .

c09.qxd 10/30/10 3:25 PM Page 404
404 CHAP. 9 Vector Differential Calculus. Grad, Div, Curl
Hence we have the basic result that the divergence of the gradient is the Laplacian
(Sec. 9.7),
(3) div (grad f )(cid:2)(cid:14)2f.
EXAMPLE 1 Gravitational Force. Laplace’s Equation
The gravitational force pin Theorem 3 of the last section is the gradient of the scalar function f(x, y, z)(cid:2)c r,
which satisfies Laplaces equation (cid:14)2f(cid:2)0. According to (3) this implies that div p(cid:2)0 (r(cid:6)0).
>(cid:2)
The following example from hydrodynamics shows the physical significance of the
divergence of a vector field. We shall get back to this topic in Sec. 10.8 and add further
physical details.
EXAMPLE 2 Flow of a Compressible Fluid. Physical Meaning of the Divergence
We consider the motion of a fluid in a region Rhaving no sourcesor sinksin R, that is, no points at which
fluid is produced or disappears. The concept of fluid stateis meant to cover also gases and vapors. Fluids in
the restricted sense, or liquids, such as water or oil, have very small compressibility, which can be neglected in
many problems. In contrast, gases and vapors have high compressibility. Their density r ((cid:2) mass per unit volume)
depends on the coordinates x, y, z in space and may also depend on time t. We assume that our fluid is
compressible. We consider the flow through a rectangular box B of small edges ¢x, ¢y, ¢z parallel to the
coordinate axes as shown in Fig. 218. (Here ¢ is a standard notation for small quantities and, of course, has
nothing to do with the notation for the Laplacian in (11) of Sec. 9.7.) The box Bhas the volume ¢V(cid:2)¢x ¢y ¢z.
Let v(cid:2)[v , v , v ](cid:2)v i(cid:4)v j(cid:4)v kbe the velocity vector of the motion. We set

(4) u(cid:2)rv(cid:2)[u , u , u ](cid:2)u i(cid:4)u j(cid:4)u k
1 2 3 1 2 3
and assume that uand vare continuously differentiable vector functions of x, y, z, and t,that is, they have first
partial derivatives which are continuous. Let us calculate the change in the mass included in Bby considering
the fluxacross the boundary, that is, the total loss of mass leaving Bper unit time. Consider the flow through
the left of the three faces of Bthat are visible in Fig. 218, whose area is ¢x¢z. Since the vectors v iand v k
1 3
are parallel to that face, the components v and v of vcontribute nothing to this flow. Hence the mass of fluid
1 3
entering through that face during a short time interval ¢tis given approximately by
(rv ) ¢x ¢z ¢t(cid:2)(u ) ¢x ¢z ¢t,
2y 2y
where the subscript yindicates that this expression refers to the left face. The mass of fluid leaving the box B
through the opposite face during the same time interval is approximately (u 2) y(cid:4)¢y ¢x ¢z ¢t, where the subscript
y(cid:4)¢yindicates that this expression refers to the right face (which is not visible in Fig. 218). The difference

parallel faces of B. If we add these three expressions, we find that the total loss of mass in Bduring the time
interval ¢tis approximately

This relation is known as the condition of incompressibility. It expresses the fact that the balance of outflow
and inflow for a given volume element is zero at any time. Clearly, the assumption that the flow has no sources
or sinks in Ris essential to our argument. vis also referred to as solenoidal.
From this discussion you should conclude and remember that, roughly speaking, the divergence measures

divergence, follows in the next chapter (Sec. 10.7).

Curl of a Vector Field
The concepts of gradient (Sec. 9.7), divergence (Sec. 9.8), and curl are of fundamental
importance in vector calculus and frequently applied in vector fields. In this section
we define and discuss the concept of the curl and apply it to several engineering
problems.

This is the formula when x, y, zare right-handed.If they are left-handed,the determinant
has a minus sign in front (just as in (2**) in Sec. 9.3).
Instead of curl v one also uses the notation rot v. This is suggested by “rotation,”
an application explored in Example 2. Note that curl v is a vector, as shown in
Theorem 3.

The curl has many applications. A typical example follows. More about the nature and
significance of the curl will be considered in Sec. 10.9.
EXAMPLE 2 Rotation of a Rigid Body. Relation to the Curl
We have seen in Example 5, Sec. 9.3, that a rotation of a rigid body B about a fixed axis in space can be
described by a vector wof magnitude vin the direction of the axis of rotation, where v ((cid:6)0)is the angular
speed of the rotation, and wis directed so that the rotation appears clockwise if we look in the direction of w.
According to (9), Sec. 9.3, the velocity field of the rotation can be represented in the form
v(cid:2)w(cid:2)r
where ris the position vector of a moving point with respect to a Cartesian coordinate system having the origin
on the axis of rotation. Let us choose right-handed Cartesian coordinates such that the axis of rotation is the
z-axis. Then (see Example 2 in Sec. 9.4)
w(cid:2)[0, 0, v](cid:2)vk, v(cid:2)w(cid:2)r(cid:2)[(cid:3)vy, vx, 0](cid:2)(cid:3)vyi(cid:4)vxj.

This proves the following theorem.
THEOREM 1 Rotating Body and Curl
The curl of the velocity field of a rotating rigid body has the direction of
theaxisof the rotation, and its magnitude equals twice the angular speed of the
rotation.
Next we show how the grad, div, and curl are interrelated, thereby shedding further light
on the nature of the curl.

THEOREM 2 Grad, Div, Curl
Gradient fields are irrotational. That is, if a continuously differentiable vector
function is the gradient of a scalar function f, then its curl is the zero vector,
(2) curl(grad f )(cid:2)0.
Furthermore, the divergence of the curl of a twice continuously differentiable vector
function v is zero,
(3) div(curl v)(cid:2)0.
PROOF Both (2) and (3) follow directly from the definitions by straightforward calculation. In the
proof of (3) the six terms cancel in pairs. (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 3 Rotational and Irrotational Fields
The field in Example 2 is not irrotational. A similar velocity field is obtained by stirring tea or coffee in a cup.
The gravitational field in Theorem 3 of Sec. 9.7 has curl p(cid:2)0. It is an irrotational gradient field. (cid:2)
The term “irrotational” for curl v(cid:2)0is suggested by the use of the curl for characterizing
the rotation in a field. If a gradient field occurs elsewhere, not as a velocity field, it is
usually called conservative (see Sec. 9.7). Relation (3) is plausible because of the
interpretation of the curl as a rotation and of the divergence as a flux (see Example 2 in
Sec. 9.8).
Finally, since the curl is defined in terms of coordinates, we should do what we did for
the gradient in Sec. 9.7, namely, to find out whether the curl is a vector. This is true, as
follows.
THEOREM 3 Invariance of the Curl
curl vis a vector. It has a length and a direction that are independent of the particular
choice of a Cartesian coordinate system in space.
PROOF The proof is quite involved and shown in App. 4.
We have completed our discussion of vector differential calculus. The companion
Chap. 10 on vector integral calculus follows and makes use of many concepts covered
in this chapter, including dot and cross products, parametric representation of curves C,
along with grad, div, and curl.

Vector Integral Calculus.
Integral Theorems
Vector integral calculus can be seen as a generalization of regular integral calculus. You
may wish to review integration. (To refresh your memory, there is an optional review
section on double integrals; see Sec. 10.3.)
Indeed, vector integral calculus extends integrals as known from regular calculus to
integrals over curves, called line integrals(Secs. 10.1, 10.2), surfaces, called surface integrals
(Sec. 10.6), and solids, called triple integrals (Sec. 10.7). The beauty of vector integral
calculus is that we can transform these different integrals into one another. You do this
to simplify evaluations, that is, one type of integral might be easier to solve than another,
such as in potential theory (Sec. 10.8). More specifically, Green’s theorem in the plane
allows you to transform line integrals into double integrals, or conversely, double integrals
into line integrals, as shown in Sec. 10.4. Gauss’s convergence theorem (Sec. 10.7) converts
surface integrals into triple integrals, and vice-versa, and Stokes’s theorem deals with
converting line integrals into surface integrals, and vice-versa.
This chapter is a companion to Chapter 9 on vector differential calculus. From Chapter 9,
you will need to know inner product, curl, and divergence and how to parameterize curves.
The root of the transformation of the integrals was largely physical intuition. Since the
corresponding formulas involve the divergence and the curl, the study of this material will
lead to a deeper physical understanding of these two operations.
Vector integral calculus is very important to the engineer and physicist and has many
applications in solid mechanics, in fluid flow, in heat problems, and others.

Recall that, in (1), we integrate the function f(x),also known as the integrand, from x(cid:2)a
along the x-axis to x(cid:2)b. Now, in a line integral, we shall integrate a given function, also

called the integrand, along a curve C in space or in the plane. (Hence curve integral
would be a better name but line integral is standard).
This requires that we represent the curve Cby a parametric representation (as in Sec. 9.5)
(2) r(t)(cid:2)[x(t), y(t), z(t)](cid:2)x(t)i(cid:4)y(t)j(cid:4)z(t)k (a(cid:3)t(cid:3)b).
The curve Cis called the path of integration.Look at Fig. 219a. The path of integration
goes from A to B. Thus A: r(a) is its initial point and B: r(b) is its terminal point. C is
now oriented. The direction from A to B, in which t increases is called the positive
direction on C. We mark it by an arrow. The points Aand Bmay coincide, as it happens
in Fig. 219b. Then C is called a closed path.
Cis called a smooth curveif it has at each point a unique tangent whose direction varies
continuously as we move along C. We note that r(t) in (2) is differentiable. Its derivative
rr (t)(cid:2)dr dt is continuous and different from the zero vector at every point of C.
>
General Assumption
In this book, every path of integration of a line integral is assumed to be piecewise smooth,
that is, it consists of finitely many smooth curves.
For example, the boundary curve of a square is piecewise smooth. It consists of four
smooth curves or, in this case, line segments which are the four sides of the square.
Definition and Evaluation of Line Integrals
A line integral of a vector function F(r) over a curve C: r(t) is defined by
(3) (cid:2) F(r)•dr(cid:2) (cid:2)b F(r(t))•rr (t) dt rr (cid:2) dr
dt
C a
where r(t) is the parametric representation of Cas given in (2). (The dot product was defined
in Sec. 9.2.) Writing (3) in terms of components, with dr(cid:2)[dx, dy, dz] as in Sec. 9.5
and r (cid:2)d dt, we get

If the path of integration C in (3) is a closed curve, then instead of
(cid:2) (cid:4)
we also write .
C C
Note that the integrand in (3) is a scalar, not a vector, because we take the dot product. Indeed,
F•rr ƒrrƒ
is the tangential component of F. (For “component” see (11) in Sec. 9.2.)
>
We see that the integral in (3) on the right is a definite integral of a function of ttaken
over the interval a(cid:5)t(cid:5)b on the t-axis in the positive direction: The direction of
increasing t. This definite integral exists for continuous Fand piecewise smooth C, because
this makes
F•rr
piecewise continuous.
Line integrals (3) arise naturally in mechanics, where they give the work done by a
force F in a displacement along C. This will be explained in detail below. We may thus
call the line integral (3) the work integral. Other forms of the line integral will be discussed
later in this section.

If the sense of integration along Cis reversed, the value of the integral is multiplied by(cid:5)1.
However, we note the following independence if the sense is preserved.
THEOREM 1 Direction-Preserving Parametric Transformations
Any representations of C that give the same positive direction on C also yield the
same value of the line integral (3).
PROOF The proof follows by the chain rule. Let r(t) be the given representation with a(cid:3)t(cid:3)b
as in (3). Consider the transformation t(cid:2)(cid:2)(t*) which transforms the t interval to
a*(cid:3)t*(cid:3)b* and has a positive derivative dt dt*. We write r(t)(cid:2)r((cid:2)(t*))(cid:2)r*(t*).

Motivation of the Line Integral (3):
Work Done by a Force
The work W done by a constant force F in the displacement along a straight segment d
is W(cid:2)F•d; see Example 2 in Sec. 9.2. This suggests that we define the work W done
by a variable force F in the displacement along a curve C: r(t) as the limit of sums of
works done in displacements along small chords of C. We show that this definition amounts
to defining W by the line integral (3).
For this we choose points t ((cid:2)a)(cid:7)t (cid:7) Á (cid:7)t ((cid:2)b). Then the work ¢W done
0 1 n m
by F(r(t )) in the straight displacement from r(t ) to r(t ) is
m m m(cid:4)1
¢W (cid:2)F(r(t )) •[r(t )(cid:5)r(t )] (cid:3)F(r(t )) •rr (t )¢t (¢t (cid:2) ¢t (cid:5)t ).
m m m(cid:4)1 m m m m m m(cid:4)1 m
The sum of these n works is W (cid:2) ¢W (cid:4)Á(cid:4) ¢W . If we choose points and
n 0 n(cid:2)1
consider W for every n arbitrarily but so that the greatest ¢t approaches zero as
n m
n:(cid:6), then the limit of W as n:(cid:6) is the line integral (3). This integral exists
n
because of our general assumption that F is continuous and C is piecewise smooth;

this makes r (t) continuous, except at finitely many points where C may have corners
or cusps. (cid:2)

Path Dependence
Path dependence of line integrals is practically and theoretically so important that we
formulate it as a theorem. And a whole section (Sec. 10.2) will be devoted to conditions
under which path dependence does not occur.
THEOREM 2 Path Dependence
The line integral (3) generally depends not only on F and on the endpoints A and
B of the path, but also on the path itself along which the integral is taken.
PROOF Almost any example will show this. Take, for instance, the straight segment C : r (t) (cid:2)

Path Independence of Line Integrals
We want to find out under what conditions, in some domain, a line integral takes on the
same value no matter what path of integration is taken (in that domain). As before we
consider line integrals
(cid:2) (cid:2)

1 2 3
B C C
D The line integral (1) is said to be path independent in a domain Din space if for every
pair of endpoints A, Bin domain D, (1) has the same value for all paths in Dthat begin at
A A and end at B. This is illustrated in Fig. 224. (See Sec. 9.6 for “domain.”)
Path independence is important. For instance, in mechanics it may mean that we have
Fig. 224. Path to do the same amount of work regardless of the path to the mountaintop, be it short and
independence steep or long and gentle. Or it may mean that in releasing an elastic spring we get back
the work done in expanding it. Not all forces are of this type—think of swimming in a
big round pool in which the water is rotating as in a whirlpool.
We shall follow up with three ideas about path independence. We shall see that path
independence of (1) in a domain D holds if and only if:
(Theorem 1) F(cid:2)grad f, where grad f is the gradient of f as explained in Sec. 9.7.
(Theorem 2) Integration around closed curves C in D always gives 0.
(Theorem 3) curl F(cid:2)0, provided D is simply connected, as defined below.
Do you see that these theorems can help in understanding the examples and counterexample
just mentioned?
Let us begin our discussion with the following very practical criterion for path
independence.

Potential theoryrelates to our present discussion if we remember from Sec. 9.7 that when
F(cid:2)grad f, then f is called a potential of F. Thus the integral (1) is independent of path
in D if and only if F is the gradient of a potential in D.

Path Independence and Integration
Around Closed Curves
The simple idea is that two paths with common endpoints (Fig. 225) make up a single
closed curve. This gives almost immediately
THEOREM 2 Path Independence
The integral (1) is path independent in a domain D if and only if its value around
every closed path in D is zero.
PROOF If we have path independence, then integration from A to B along C and along C in
1 2
Fig. 225 gives the same value. Now C and C together make up a closed curve C, and
1 2
C 1 if we integrate from A along C 1 to B as before, but then in the opposite sense along C 2
B back to A (so that this second integral is multiplied by (cid:5)1), the sum of the two integrals
is zero, but this is the integral around the closed curve C.
Conversely, assume that the integral around any closed path Cin Dis zero. Given any
A points Aand Band any two curves C and C from Ato Bin D, we see that C with the
1 2 1
C orientation reversed and C together form a closed path C. By assumption, the integral

Work. Conservative and Nonconservative (Dissipative) Physical Systems
Recall from the last section that in mechanics, the integral (1) gives the work done by a
force Fin the displacement of a body along the curve C. Then Theorem 2 states that work
is path independent in D if and only if its value is zero for displacement around every
closed path in D. Furthermore, Theorem 1 tells us that this happens if and only if Fis the
gradient of a potential in D. In this case, F and the vector field defined by F are called
conservative in D because in this case mechanical energy is conserved; that is, no work
is done in the displacement from a point Aand back to A. Similarly for the displacement
of an electrical charge (an electron, for instance) in a conservative electrostatic field.
Physically, the kinetic energy of a body can be interpreted as the ability of the body to
do work by virtue of its motion, and if the body moves in a conservative field of force,
after the completion of a round trip the body will return to its initial position with the
same kinetic energy it had originally. For instance, the gravitational force is conservative;
if we throw a ball vertically up, it will (if we assume air resistance to be negligible) return
to our hand with the same kinetic energy it had when it left our hand.
Friction, air resistance, and water resistance always act against the direction of motion.
They tend to diminish the total mechanical energy of a system, usually converting it into
heat or mechanical energy of the surrounding medium (possibly both). Furthermore,
if during the motion of a body, these forces become so large that they can no longer
be neglected, then the resultant force F of the forces acting on the body is no longer
conservative. This leads to the following terms. A physical system is called conservative
if all the forces acting in it are conservative. If this does not hold, then the physical system
is called nonconservative or dissipative.
Path Independence and Exactness
of Differential Forms
Theorem 1 relates path independence of the line integral (1) to the gradient and Theorem 2
to integration around closed curves. A third idea (leading to Theorems 3* and 3, below)
relates path independence to the exactness of the differential form or Pfaffian form1
(4) F•dr(cid:2)F dx(cid:4)F dy(cid:4)F dz

under the integral sign in (1). This form (4) is called exact in a domain D in space if it
is the differential

of a differentiable function f(x, y, z) everywhere in D, that is, if we have
F•dr(cid:2)df.
Comparing these two formulas, we see that the form (4) is exact if and only if there is a
differentiable function f (x, y, z) in D such that everywhere in D,

THEOREM 3* Path Independence
The integral(1) is path independent in a domain D in space if and only if the differential
form(4) has continuous coefficient functionsF , F , F and is exact in D.
1 2 3
This theorem is of practical importance because it leads to a useful exactness criterion.
First we need the following concept, which is of general interest.
A domain Dis called simply connectedif every closed curve in Dcan be continuously
shrunk to any point in D without leaving D.
For example, the interior of a sphere or a cube, the interior of a sphere with finitely many
points removed, and the domain between two concentric spheres are simply connected. On
the other hand, the interior of a torus, which is a doughnut as shown in Fig. 249 in Sec. 10.6
is not simply connected. Neither is the interior of a cube with one space diagonal removed.
The criterion for exactness (and path independence by Theorem 3*) is now as follows.
THEOREM 3 Criterion for Exactness and Path Independence

(b) If (6) holds in D and D is simply connected, then (4) is exact in D—and
thus (1) is path independent by Theorem 3*.

curl F(cid:2)curl (grad f )(cid:2)0 by (2) in Sec. 9.9, so that (6) holds.

Calculus Review: Double Integrals.
Optional
This section is optional. Students familiar with double integrals from calculus should
skip this review and go on to Sec. 10.4. This section is included in the book to make it
reasonably self-contained.
In a definite integral (1), Sec. 10.1, we integrate a function f(x) over an interval
(a segment) of the x-axis. In a double integral we integrate a function f(x, y), called the
integrand,over a closed bounded region2Rin the xy-plane, whose boundary curve has a
unique tangent at almost every point, but may perhaps have finitely many cusps (such as
the vertices of a triangle or rectangle).
The definition of the double integral is quite similar to that of the definite integral. We
subdivide the region Rby drawing parallels to the x- and y-axes (Fig. 227). We number the
rectangles that are entirely within Rfrom 1 to n. In each such rectangle we choose a point,
say, (x , y )in the kth rectangle, whose area we denote by ¢A .Then we form the sum

This we do for larger and larger positive integers nin a completely independent manner,
but so that the length of the maximum diagonal of the rectangles approaches zero as n

approaches infinity. In this fashion we obtain a sequence of real numbers J , J , .

Assuming that f(x, y)is continuous in Rand Ris bounded by finitely many smooth curves
(see Sec. 10.1), one can show (see Ref. [GenRef4] in App. 1) that this sequence converges
and its limit is independent of the choice of subdivisions and corresponding points
(x , y ). This limit is called the double integral of f(x, y) over the region R, and is

Double integrals have properties quite similar to those of definite integrals. Indeed, for

Here y(cid:2)g(x)and y(cid:2)h(x)represent the boundary curve of R(see Fig. 229) and, keeping
xconstant, we integrate f(x, y)over yfrom g(x)to h(x). The result is a function of x, and
we integrate it from x(cid:2)a to x(cid:2)b (Fig. 229).
Similarly, for integrating first over x and then over y the formula is

The boundary curve of R is now represented by x(cid:2)p(y) and x(cid:2)q(y). Treating y as a
constant, we first integrate f(x, y) over x from p(y) to q(y) (see Fig. 230) and then the
resulting function of y from y(cid:2)c to y(cid:2)d.
In (3) we assumed that Rcan be given by inequalities a(cid:3)x(cid:3)b and g(x) (cid:3)y(cid:3)h(x).
Similarly in (4) by c(cid:3)y(cid:3)dand p(y)(cid:3)x(cid:3)q(y).If a region Rhas no such representation,
then, in any practical case, it will at least be possible to subdivide R into finitely many
portions each of which can be given by those inequalities. Then we integrate f(x, y)over
each portion and take the sum of the results. This will give the value of the integral of
f(x, y) over the entire region R.
Applications of Double Integrals
Double integrals have various physical and geometric applications. For instance, the area
A of a region R in the xy-plane is given by the double integral
(cid:2) (cid:2)
A(cid:2) dx dy.

between a and b when u varies between a and b.

R and, conversely, to every (x, y) in R there corresponds one and only one (u, v) in R*;
furthermore, the Jacobian J is either positive throughout R* or negative throughout R*.

Green’s Theorem in the Plane
Double integrals over a plane region may be transformed into line integrals over the
boundary of the region and conversely. This is of practical interest because it may simplify
the evaluation of an integral. It also helps in theoretical work when we want to switch from
one kind of integral to the other. The transformation can be done by the following theorem.
THEOREM 1 Green’s Theorem in the Plane4
(Transformation between Double Integrals and Line Integrals)
Let R be a closed bounded region (see Sec. 10.3) in the xy-plane whose boundary
C consists of finitely many smooth curves (see Sec. 10.1). Let F (x, y) and F (x, y)

4GEORGE GREEN (1793–1841), English mathematician who was self-educated, started out as a baker, and
at his death was fellow of Caius College, Cambridge. His work concerned potential theory in connection with
electricity and magnetism, vibrations, waves, and elasticity theory. It remained almost unknown, even in England,
until after his death.
A “domain containing R” in the theorem guarantees that the assumptions about F and F at boundary points

EXAMPLE 1 Verification of Green’s Theorem in the Plane
Green’s theorem in the plane will be quite important in our further work. Before proving it, let us get used to
it by verifying it for F (cid:2)y2(cid:5)7y, F (cid:2)2xy(cid:4)2xand Cthe circle x2(cid:4)y2(cid:2)1.

R R R
since the circular disk Rhas area p.
We now show that the line integral in (1) on the right gives the same value, 9p. We must orient C
counterclockwise, say, r(t)(cid:2)[cos t, sin t].Then rr (t)(cid:2)[(cid:5)sin t, cos t],and on C,

Since y(cid:2)v(x) represents the curve C** (Fig. 235) and y(cid:2)u(x) represents C*, the last

The result remains valid if C has portions parallel to the y-axis (such as C and C in
Fig. 237). Indeed, the integrals over these portions are zero because in (3) on the right we
integrate with respect to x. Hence we may add these integrals to the integrals over C*and
C** to obtain the integral over the whole boundary C in (3).
We now treat the first term in (1) on the left in the same way. Instead of (3) in the last
section we use (4), and the second representation of the special region (see Fig. 236).

Together with (3) this gives (1) and proves Green’s theorem for special regions.
We now prove the theorem for a region R that itself is not a special region but can be
subdivided into finitely many special regions as shown in Fig. 238. In this case we apply
the theorem to each subregion and then add the results; the left-hand members add up to
the integral over R while the right-hand members add up to the line integral over C plus

integrals over the curves introduced for subdividing R. The simple key observation now
is that each of the latter integrals occurs twice, taken once in each direction. Hence they
cancel each other, leaving us with the line integral over C.
The proof thus far covers all regions that are of interest in practical problems. To prove
the theorem for a most general region Rsatisfying the conditions in the theorem, we must
approximate R by a region of the type just considered and then use a limiting process.
For details of this see Ref. [GenRef4] in App. 1.

EXAMPLE 4 Transformation of a Double Integral of the Laplacian of a Function
into a Line Integral of Its Normal Derivative
The Laplacian plays an important role in physics and engineering. A first impression of this was obtained in
Sec. 9.7, and we shall discuss this further in Chap. 12. At present, let us use Green’s theorem for deriving a
basic integral formula involving the Laplacian.
We take a function w(x, y) that is continuous and has continuous first and second partial derivatives in a
domain of the xy-plane containing a region Rof the type indicated in Green’s theorem. We set F (cid:2)(cid:5)0w 0y

Green’s theorem in the plane can be used in both directions, and thus may aid in the
evaluation of a given integral by transforming the given integral into another integral that
is easier to solve. This is illustrated further in the problem set. Moreover, and perhaps
more fundamentally, Green’s theorem will be the essential tool in the proof of a very
important integral theorem, namely, Stokes’s theorem in Sec. 10.9.

SEC. 10.5 Surfaces for Surface Integrals 439
10.5
Surfaces for Surface Integrals
Whereas, with line integrals, we integrate over curves in space (Secs. 10.1, 10.2), with
surface integrals we integrate over surfaces in space. Each curve in space is represented
by a parametric equation (Secs. 9.5, 10.1). This suggests that we should also find
parametric representations for the surfaces in space. This is indeed one of the goals of
this section. The surfaces considered are cylinders, spheres, cones, and others. The
second goal is to learn about surface normals. Both goals prepare us for Sec. 10.6 on
surface integrals. Note that for simplicity, we shall say “surface” also for a portion of
a surface.
Representation of Surfaces
Representations of a surface S in xyz-space are
(1) z(cid:2)f(x, y) or g(x, y, z)(cid:2)0.
For example, z(cid:2)(cid:4)2a2(cid:5)x2(cid:5)y2 or x2(cid:4)y2(cid:4)z2(cid:5)a2(cid:2)0 (z (cid:11)0) represents a
hemisphere of radius a and center 0.
Now for curves Cin line integrals, it was more practical and gave greater flexibility to
use a parametric representation r(cid:2)r(t), where a(cid:3)t(cid:3)b. This is a mapping of the
interval a(cid:3)t(cid:3)b, located on the t-axis, onto the curve C (actually a portion of it) in
xyz-space. It maps every t in that interval onto the point of C with position vector r(t).
See Fig. 241A.
Similarly, for surfaces S in surface integrals, it will often be more practical to use a
parametricrepresentation. Surfaces are two-dimensional. Hence we need twoparameters,

which we call u and v. Thus a parametric representation of a surface S in space is of
the form
(2) r(u, v)(cid:2)[x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)](cid:2)x(u, v)i(cid:4)y(u, v)j(cid:4)z(u, v)k
where (u, v) varies in some region Rof the uv-plane. This mapping (2) maps every point
(u, v) in R onto the point of S with position vector r(u, v). See Fig. 241B.
EXAMPLE 1 Parametric Representation of a Cylinder
The circular cylinder x2(cid:4)y2(cid:2)a2, (cid:5)1(cid:3)z(cid:3)1,has radius a, height 2, and the z-axis as axis. A parametric

Check that x2(cid:4)y2(cid:2)z2,as it should be. What are the curves u(cid:2)constand v(cid:2)const? (cid:2)
Tangent Plane and Surface Normal
Recall from Sec. 9.7 that the tangent vectors of all the curves on a surface Sthrough a point
Pof Sform a plane, called the tangent planeof Sat P(Fig. 244). Exceptions are points where
Shas an edge or a cusp (like a cone), so that Scannot have a tangent plane at such a point.
Furthermore, a vector perpendicular to the tangent plane is called a normal vectorof Sat P.
Now since S can be given by r(cid:2)r(u, v) in (2), the new idea is that we get a curve C
on S by taking a pair of differentiable functions
u(cid:2)u(t), v(cid:2)v(t)
whose derivatives ur (cid:2)du dt and vr (cid:2)dv dt are continuous. Then C has the position
vector ~ r(t)(cid:2)r(u(t), v(t)). B> y differentiation> and the use of the chain rule (Sec. 9.6) we
obtain a tangent vector of C on S
~ rr (t)(cid:2) d ~ r (cid:2) 0r ur (cid:4) 0r vr .
dt 0u 0v
Hence the partial derivativesr and r atP are tangential to S at P.We assume that they
u v
are linearly independent, which geometrically means that the curves u(cid:2)const and
v(cid:2)const on S intersect at P at a nonzero angle. Then r and r span the tangent plane
u v
of S at P. Hence their cross product gives a normal vector N of S at P.

A surface S is called a smooth surface if its surface normal depends continuously on
the points of S.
S is called piecewise smooth if it consists of finitely many smooth portions.
For instance, a sphere is smooth, and the surface of a cube is piecewise smooth
(explain!). We can now summarize our discussion as follows.

If a surface S is given by(2) with continuousr (cid:2) 0r 0uandr (cid:2) 0r 0vsatisfying

(4) at every point of S, then S has, at every point P, a unique tangent plane passing
through P and spanned byr andr ,and a unique normal whose direction depends
u v
continuously on the points of S. A normal vector is given by(4) and the corresponding
unit normal vector by (5). (See Fig. 244.)
EXAMPLE 4 Unit Normal Vector of a Sphere

At the apex of the cone g(x, y, z)(cid:2)(cid:5)z(cid:4) 2x2(cid:4)y2(cid:2)0 in Example 3, the unit normal vector n becomes

Surface Integrals
To define a surface integral, we take a surface S, given by a parametric representation as
just discussed,
(1) r(u, v)(cid:2)[x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)](cid:2)x(u, v)i(cid:4)y(u, v)j(cid:4)z(u, v)k
where (u, v) varies over a region Rin the uv-plane. We assume Sto be piecewise smooth
(Sec. 10.5), so that S has a normal vector

at every point (except perhaps for some edges or cusps, as for a cube or cone). For a given
vector function F we can now define the surface integral over S by
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)
(3) F•n dA (cid:2) F(r(u, v))•N(u, v) du dv.

And we see that dA(cid:2) ƒNƒdu dv is the element of area of S.

Also F•nis the normal component of F. This integral arises naturally in flow problems,
where it gives the fluxacross Swhen F(cid:2)rv.Recall, from Sec. 9.8, that the flux across
S is the mass of fluid crossing S per unit time. Furthermore, r is the density of the fluid
and v the velocity vector of the flow, as illustrated by Example 1 below. We may thus
call the surface integral (3) the flux integral.
We can write (3) in components, using F(cid:2)[F , F , F ], N (cid:2)[N , N , N ],

and n(cid:2)[cos a, cos b, cos g]. Here, a, b, g are the angles between n and the coordinate

In (4) we can write cos a dA (cid:2)dy dz, cos b dA(cid:2)dz dx, cos g dA(cid:2)dx dy. Then (4)

We can use this formula to evaluate surface integrals by converting them to double integrals
over regions in the coordinate planes of the xyz-coordinate system. But we must carefully
take into account the orientation of S (the choice of n). We explain this for the integrals
of the F -terms,

If the surface S is given by z(cid:2)h(x, y) with (x, y) varying in a region R in the xy-plane,
and if S is oriented so that cos g (cid:6)0, then (5r ) gives
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)

But if cos g (cid:4)0,the integral on the right of (5s )gets a minus sign in front. This follows
if we note that the element of area dx dy in the xy-plane is the projection ƒcos gƒ dA
of the element of area dA of S; and we have cos g (cid:2)(cid:7)ƒcos gƒ when cos g (cid:6)0, but
cos g (cid:2)(cid:5)ƒcos gƒ when cos g (cid:4)0.Similarly for the other two terms in (5). At the same
time, this justifies the notations in (5).
Other forms of surface integrals will be discussed later in this section.

Orientation of Surfaces
From (3) or (4) we see that the value of the integral depends on the choice of the unit
normal vector n. (Instead of nwe could choose (cid:5)n.) We express this by saying that such
an integral is an integral over an oriented surface S, that is, over a surface S on which
we have chosen one of the two possible unit normal vectors in a continuous fashion. (For
a piecewise smooth surface, this needs some further discussion, which we give below.)
If we change the orientation of S, this means that we replace n with (cid:5)n. Then each
component of n in (4) is multiplied by (cid:5)1, so that we have
THEOREM 1 Change of Orientation in a Surface Integral
The replacement ofnby(cid:5)n(hence ofNby(cid:5)N) corresponds to the multiplication
of the integral in (3) or (4) by (cid:5)1.
In practice, how do we make such a change of N happen, if S is given in the form (1)?
The easiest way is to interchange u and v, because then r becomes r and conversely,
u v
so that N(cid:2)r (cid:2)r becomes r (cid:2)r (cid:2)(cid:5)r (cid:2)r (cid:2)(cid:5)N, as wanted. Let us illustrate

this.

Orientation of Smooth Surfaces
A smooth surface S (see Sec. 10.5) is called orientable if the positive normal direction,
when given at an arbitrary point P of S, can be continued in a unique and continuous
0
way to the entire surface. In many practical applications, the surfaces are smooth and thus
orientable.

Orientation of Piecewise Smooth Surfaces
Here the following idea will do it. For a smoothorientable surface Swith boundary curve
C we may associate with each of the two possible orientations of S an orientation of C,
as shown in Fig. 247a. Then a piecewise smooth surface is called orientable if we can
orient each smooth piece of Sso that along each curve C*which is a common boundary
of two pieces S and S the positive direction of C* relative to S is opposite to the
1 2 1
direction of C* relative to S . See Fig. 247b for two adjacent pieces; note the arrows

along C*.
Theory: Nonorientable Surfaces
A sufficiently small piece of a smooth surface is always orientable.This may not hold for
entire surfaces. A well-known example is the Möbius strip,5shown in Fig. 248. To make
a model, take the rectangular paper in Fig. 248, make a half-twist, and join the short sides
together so that A goes onto A, and B onto B. At P take a normal vector pointing, say,
0
to the left.Displace it along Cto the right (in the lower part of the figure) around the strip
until you return to P and see that you get a normal vector pointing to the right,opposite
0
to the given one. See also Prob. 17.

Triple Integrals.
Divergence Theorem of Gauss
In this section we discuss another “big” integral theorem, the divergence theorem, which
transforms surface integrals into triple integrals. So let us begin with a review of the
latter.
A triple integral is an integral of a function f(x, y, z) taken over a closed bounded,
three-dimensional region T in space. (Note that “closed” and “bounded” are defined in
the same way as in footnote 2 of Sec. 10.3, with “sphere” substituted for “circle”). We
subdivide Tby planes parallel to the coordinate planes. Then we consider those boxes of
the subdivision that lie entirely inside T, and number them from 1 to n. Here each box
consists of a rectangular parallelepiped. In each such box we choose an arbitrary point,
say, (x , y , z )in box k. The volume of box kwe denote by ¢V . We now form the sum

This we do for larger and larger positive integers n arbitrarily but so that the maximum
length of all the edges of those n boxes approaches zero as n approaches infinity. This

domain containing T, and T is bounded by finitely many smooth surfaces (see Sec. 10.5).
Then it can be shown (see Ref. [GenRef4] in App. 1) that the sequence converges to
a limit that is independent of the choice of subdivisions and corresponding points

Triple integrals can be evaluated by three successive integrations. This is similar to the
evaluation of double integrals by two successive integrations, as discussed in Sec. 10.3.
Example 1 below explains this.
Divergence Theorem of Gauss
Triple integrals can be transformed into surface integrals over the boundary surface of a
region in space and conversely. Such a transformation is of practical interest because one
of the two kinds of integral is often simpler than the other. It also helps in establishing
fundamental equations in fluid flow, heat conduction, etc., as we shall see. The transformation
is done by the divergence theorem, which involves the divergence of a vector function

in (5s ), Sec. 10.6], and the second integral gets a minus sign because cos g (cid:5)0 on S .
2
This proves (5).
The relations (3) and (4) now follow by merely relabeling the variables and using the
fact that, by assumption, T has representations similar to (6), namely,
(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
g(y, z) (cid:4)x(cid:4)h(y, z) and g(z, x)(cid:4)y(cid:4) h(z, x).
This proves the first equation in (2*) for special regions. It implies (2) because the left side
of (2*) is just the definition of the divergence, and the right sides of (2) and of the first
equation in (2*) are equal, as was shown in the first line of (4) in the last section. Finally,
equality of the right sides of (2) and (2*), last line, is seen from (5) in the last section.
This establishes the divergence theorem for special regions.

456 CHAP. 10 Vector Integral Calculus. Integral Theorems
For any region Tthat can be subdivided into finitely manyspecial regions by means of
auxiliary surfaces, the theorem follows by adding the result for each part separately. This
procedure is analogous to that in the proof of Green’s theorem in Sec. 10.4. The surface
integrals over the auxiliary surfaces cancel in pairs, and the sum of the remaining surface
integrals is the surface integral over the whole boundary surface Sof T;the triple integrals
over the parts of T add up to the triple integral over T.
The divergence theorem is now proved for any bounded region that is of interest in
practical problems. The extension to a most general region T of the type indicated in the
theorem would require a certain limit process; this is similar to the situation in the case
of Green’s theorem in Sec. 10.4. (cid:2)

Coordinate Invariance of the Divergence. The divergence (1) is defined in terms of
coordinates, but we can use the divergence theorem to show that div F has a meaning
independent of coordinates.
For this purpose we first note that triple integrals have properties quite similar to those
of double integrals in Sec. 10.3. In particular, the mean value theorem for triple integrals
asserts that for any continuous function f(x, y, z)in a bounded and simply connected region
T there is a point Q:(x , y , z ) in T such that

THEOREM 2 Invariance of the Divergence
The divergence of a vector function F with continuous first partial derivatives in a
region T is independent of the particular choice of Cartesian coordinates. For any
P in T it is given by (11).
Equation (11) is sometimes used as a definitionof the divergence. Then the representation (1)
in Cartesian coordinates can be derived from (11).
Further applications of the divergence theorem follow in the problem set and in the
next section. The examples in the next section will also shed further light on the nature
of the divergence.

Further Applications
of the Divergence Theorem
The divergence theorem has many important applications: In fluid flow, it helps characterize
sourcesand sinksof fluids. In heat flow, it leads to the heat equation. In potential theory,
it gives properties of the solutions of Laplace’s equation. In this section, we assume that
the region Tand its boundary surface Sare such that the divergence theorem applies.
EXAMPLE 1 Fluid Flow. Physical Interpretation of the Divergence
From the divergence theorem we may obtain an intuitive interpretation of the divergence of a vector. For this
purpose we consider the flow of an incompressible fluid (see Sec. 9.8) of constant density r(cid:2)1which is steady,
that is, does not vary with time. Such a flow is determined by the field of its velocity vector v(P)at any point P.
Let Sbe the boundary surface of a region Tin space, and let nbe the outer unit normal vector of S. Then
v•nis the normal component of vin the direction of n, and ƒv•n dAƒ is the mass of fluid leaving T(if v•n(cid:6)0
at some P) or entering T(if v•n(cid:4)0at P) per unit time at some point Pof Sthrough a small portion ¢Sof
Sof area ¢A. Hence the total mass of fluid that flows across Sfrom Tto the outside per unit time is given by
the surface integral
(cid:2)(cid:2)
v•n dA.
S
Division by the volume Vof Tgives the average flowout of T:
1(cid:2)(cid:2)
(1) v•n dA.
V
S
Since the flow is steady and the fluid is incompressible, the amount of fluid flowing outward must be continuously
supplied. Hence, if the value of the integral (1) is different from zero, there must be sources(positive sources
and negative sources,calledsinks) in T, that is, points where fluid is produced or disappears.
If we let Tshrink down to a fixed point Pin T, we obtain from (1) the source intensityat Pgiven by the
right side of (11) in the last section with F•nreplaced by v•n, that is,
1 (cid:2)(cid:2)

SEC. 10.8 Further Applications of the Divergence Theorem 459
Hence the divergence of the velocity vectorv of a steady incompressible flow is the source intensity of the flow
at the corresponding point.
There are no sources in Tif and only if div vis zero everywhere in T. Then for any closed surface Sin Twe have
(cid:2)(cid:2)
v•n dA(cid:2)0. (cid:2)

EXAMPLE 2 Modeling of Heat Flow. Heat or Diffusion Equation
Physical experiments show that in a body, heat flows in the direction of decreasing temperature, and the rate of
flow is proportional to the gradient of the temperature. This means that the velocity vof the heat flow in a body
is of the form
(3) v(cid:2)(cid:5)K grad U
where U(x, y, z, t)is temperature, tis time, and Kis called the thermal conductivityof the body; in ordinary
physical circumstances Kis a constant. Using this information, set up the mathematical model of heat flow, the
so-called heat equationor diffusion equation.
Solution. Let Tbe a region in the body bounded by a surface Swith outer unit normal vector nsuch that
the divergence theorem applies. Then v(cid:4)nis the component of vin the direction of n, and the amount of heat
leaving Tper unit time is
(cid:2)(cid:2)
v•n dA.
S
This expression is obtained similarly to the corresponding surface integral in the last example. Using
div (grad U)(cid:2)(cid:9)2U(cid:2)U (cid:7)U (cid:7)U

(the Laplacian; see (3) in Sec. 9.8), we have by the divergence theorem and (3)

demonstration of the great importance of the divergence theorem. Methods for solving heat problems will be
shown in Chap. 12.
The heat equation is also called the diffusion equationbecause it also models diffusion processes of motions
of molecules tending to level off differences in density or pressure in gases or liquids.
If heat flow does not depend on time, it is called steady-state heat flow. Then 0U 0t(cid:2)0, so that (5) reduces

to Laplace’s equation (cid:9)2U(cid:2)0. We met this equation in Secs. 9.7 and 9.8, and we shall now see that the
(cid:2)
divergence theorem adds basic insights into the nature of solutions of this equation.

is called potential theory. A solution of (6) with continuoussecond-order partial derivatives
is called a harmonic function. That continuity is needed for application of the divergence
theorem in potential theory, where the theorem plays a key role that we want to explore.
Further details of potential theory follow in Chaps. 12 and 18.
EXAMPLE 3 A Basic Property of Solutions of Laplace’s Equation
The integrands in the divergence theorem are div Fand F•n(Sec. 10.7). If Fis the gradient of a scalar function,
say, F(cid:2)grad f, then div F(cid:2)div (grad f)(cid:2)(cid:9)2f; see (3), Sec. 9.8. Also, F•n(cid:2)n•F(cid:2)n•grad f. This is the
directional derivative of fin the outer normal direction of S, the boundary surface of the region Tin the theorem.
This derivative is called the (outer) normal derivativeof fand is denoted by 0f 0n. Thus the formula in the

This is the three-dimensional analog of (9) in Sec. 10.4. Because of the assumptions in the divergence theorem
(cid:2)
this gives the following result.
THEOREM 1 A Basic Property of Harmonic Functions
Let f(x, y, z) be a harmonic function in some domain D is space. Let S be any
piecewise smooth closed orientable surface in D whose entire region it encloses
belongs to D. Then the integral of the normal derivative of f taken over S is zero.

EXAMPLE 5 Uniqueness of Solutions of Laplace’s Equation
Let fbe harmonic in a domain Dand let fbe zero everywhere on a piecewise smooth closed orientable surface
Sin Dwhose entire region Tit encloses belongs to D. Then (cid:9)2gis zero in T, and the surface integral in (8) is

Since fis harmonic, grad fand thus ƒgrad fƒ are continuous in Tand on S, and since ƒgrad fƒ is nonnegative,
to make the integral over T zero, grad f must be the zero vector everywhere in T. Hence f (cid:2)f (cid:2)f (cid:2)0,

and fis constant in T and, because of continuity, it is equal to its value 0 on S. This proves the following
theorem.

THEOREM 2 Harmonic Functions
Letf(x, y, z)be harmonic in some domain D and zero at every point of a piecewise
smooth closed orientable surface S in D whose entire region T it encloses belongs
to D. Then f is identically zero in T.
This theorem has an important consequence. Let f and f be functions that satisfy the assumptions of Theorem
1 2
1 and take on the same values on S. Then their difference f (cid:5)f satisfies those assumptions and has the value
1 2
0 everywhere on S. Hence, Theorem 2 implies that
f (cid:5)f (cid:2)0 throughout T,

and we have the following fundamental result.
THEOREM 3 Uniqueness Theorem for Laplace’s Equation
Let T be a region that satisfies the assumptions of the divergence theorem, and let
f(x, y, z) be a harmonic function in a domain D that contains T and its boundary
surface S. Then f is uniquely determined in T by its values on S.
The problem of determining a solution uof a partial differential equation in a region Tsuch that uassumes
given values on the boundary surface Sof Tis called the Dirichlet problem.8We may thus reformulate Theorem
3 as follows.
THEOREM 3* Uniqueness Theorem for the Dirichlet Problem
If the assumptions in Theorem 3 are satisfied and the Dirichlet problem for the
Laplace equation has a solution in T, then this solution is unique.

These theorems demonstrate the extreme importance of the divergence theorem in potential theory.

Stokes’s Theorem
Let us review some of the material covered so far. Double integrals over a region in the plane
can be transformed into line integrals over the boundary curve of that region and conversely,
line integrals into double integrals. This important result is known as Green’s theorem in the
plane and was explained in Sec. 10.4. We also learned that we can transform triple integrals
into surface integrals and vice versa, that is, surface integrals into triple integrals. This “big”
theorem is called Gauss’s divergence theorem and was shown in Sec. 10.7.
To complete our discussion on transforming integrals, we now introduce another “big”
theorem that allows us to transform surface integrals into line integrals and conversely,
line integrals into surface integrals. It is called Stokes’s Theorem, and it generalizes
Green’s theorem in the plane (see Example 2 below for this immediate observation). Recall

We see that the right side of this equals the integrand in (7). This proves (3). Relations
(4) and (5) follow in the same way if we use (6b) and (6c), respectively. By addition we
obtain (2*). This proves Stokes’s theorem for a surface S that can be represented
simultaneously in the forms (6a), (6b), (6c).
As in the proof of the divergence theorem, our result may be immediately extended
to a surface S that can be decomposed into finitely many pieces, each of which is of
the kind just considered. This covers most of the cases of practical interest. The proof
in the case of a most general surface Ssatisfying the assumptions of the theorem would
require a limit process; this is similar to the situation in the case of Green’s theorem
in Sec. 10.4. (cid:2)

Solution. As a surface Sbounded by Cwe can take the plane circular disk x2(cid:7)y2(cid:3)4in the plane z(cid:2)(cid:5)3.
Then nin Stokes’s theorem points in the positive z-direction; thus n(cid:2)k. Hence (curl F)•nis simply the component
of curl Fin the positive z-direction. Since Fwith z(cid:2)(cid:5)3has the components F (cid:2)y, F (cid:2)(cid:5)27x, F (cid:2)3y3, we

Stokes’s Theorem Applied to Path Independence
We emphasized in Sec. 10.2 that the value of a line integral generally depends not only
on the function to be integrated and on the two endpoints Aand Bof the path of integration
C, but also on the particular choice of a path from Ato B. In Theorem 3 of Sec. 10.2 we
proved that if a line integral

C C
(involving continuous F , F , F that have continuous first partial derivatives) is path

independent in a domain D, then curl F(cid:2)0 in D. And we claimed in Sec. 10.2 that,
conversely, curl F(cid:2)0everywhere in Dimplies path independence of (9) in Dprovided D
is simply connected.A proof of this needs Stokes’s theorem and can now be given as follows.
Let C be any closed path in D. Since D is simply connected, we can find a surface S
in D bounded by C. Stokes’s theorem applies and gives
(cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:2)(cid:2)

for proper direction on C and normal vector n on S. Since curl F(cid:2)0 in D, the surface
integral and hence the line integral are zero. This and Theorem 2 of Sec. 10.2 imply that
the integral (9) is path independent in D. This completes the proof. (cid:2)

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Vector Integral Calculus. Integral Theorems
Chapter 9 extended differentialcalculus to vectors, that is, to vector functions v(x, y, z)
or v(t). Similarly, Chapter 10 extends integral calculus to vector functions. This
involves line integrals(Sec. 10.1), double integrals(Sec. 10.3), surface integrals(Sec.
10.6), and triple integrals (Sec. 10.7) and the three “big” theorems for transforming
these integrals into one another, the theorems of Green (Sec. 10.4), Gauss (Sec. 10.7),
and Stokes (Sec. 10.9).

space (or in the plane). Physically, (1) may represent the work done by a (variable)
force in a displacement. Other kinds of line integrals and their applications are also
discussed in Sec. 10.1.
Independence of path of a line integral in a domain D means that the integral
of a given function over any path Cwith endpoints Pand Qhas the same value for
all paths from P to Q that lie in D; here P and Q are fixed. An integral (1) is
independent of path in Dif and only if the differential form F dx(cid:7)F dy(cid:7)F dz

with continuous F , F , F is exact in D (Sec. 10.2). Also, if curl F(cid:2)0, where

CHAPTER 11 Fourier Analysis
CHAPTER 12 Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
Chapter 11 and Chapter 12 are directly related to each other in that Fourier analysis has
its most important applications in modeling and solving partial differential equations
(PDEs) related to boundary and initial value problems of mechanics, heat flow,
electrostatics, and other fields. However, the study of PDEs is a study in its own right.
Indeed, PDEs are the subject of much ongoing research.
Fourier analysis allows us to model periodic phenomena which appear frequently in
engineering and elsewhere—think of rotating parts of machines, alternating electric currents
or the motion of planets. Related period functions may be complicated. Now, the ingeneous
idea of Fourier analysis is to represent complicated functions in terms of simple periodic
functions, namely cosines and sines. The representations will be infinite series called
Fourier series.1 This idea can be generalized to more general series (see Sec. 11.5) and
to integral representations (see Sec. 11.7).
The discovery of Fourier series had a huge impetus on applied mathematics as well as on
mathematics as a whole. Indeed, its influence on the concept of a function, on integration
theory, on convergence theory, and other theories of mathematics has been substantial
(see [GenRef7] in App. 1).
Chapter 12 deals with the most important partial differential equations (PDEs) of physics
and engineering, such as the wave equation, the heat equation, and the Laplace equation.
These equations can model a vibrating string/membrane, temperatures on a bar, and
electrostatic potentials, respectively. PDEs are very important in many areas of physics
and engineering and have many more applications than ODEs.
1JEAN-BAPTISTE JOSEPH FOURIER (1768–1830), French physicist and mathematician, lived and taught
in Paris, accompanied Napoléon in the Egyptian War, and was later made prefect of Grenoble. The beginnings
on Fourier series can be found in works by Euler and by Daniel Bernoulli, but it was Fourier who employed
them in a systematic and general manner in his main work, Théorie analytique de la chaleur(Analytic Theory
of Heat,Paris, 1822), in which he developed the theory of heat conduction (heat equation; see Sec. 12.5), making
these series a most important tool in applied mathematics.

This chapter on Fourier analysis covers three broad areas: Fourier series in Secs. 11.1–11.4,
more general orthonormal series called Sturm–Liouville expansions in Secs. 11.5 and 11.6
and Fourier integrals and transforms in Secs. 11.7–11.9.
The central starting point of Fourier analysis is Fourier series. They are infinite series
designed to represent general periodic functions in terms of simple ones, namely, cosines
and sines. This trigonometric system is orthogonal, allowing the computation of the
coefficients of the Fourier series by use of the well-known Euler formulas, as shown in
Sec. 11.1. Fourier series are very important to the engineer and physicist because they
allow the solution of ODEs in connection with forced oscillations (Sec. 11.3) and the
approximation of periodic functions (Sec. 11.4). Moreover, applications of Fourier analysis
to PDEs are given in Chap. 12. Fourier series are, in a certain sense, more universal than
the familiar Taylor series in calculus because many discontinuous periodic functions that
come up in applications can be developed in Fourier series but do not have Taylor series
expansions.
The underlying idea of the Fourier series can be extended in two important ways. We
can replace the trigonometric system by other families of orthogonal functions, e.g., Bessel
functions and obtain the Sturm–Liouville expansions. Note that related Secs. 11.5 and
11.6 used to be part of Chap. 5 but, for greater readability and logical coherence, are now
part of Chap. 11. The second expansion is applying Fourier series to nonperiodic
phenomena and obtaining Fourier integrals and Fourier transforms. Both extensions have
important applications to solving PDEs as will be shown in Chap. 12.
In a digital age, the discrete Fourier transform plays an important role. Signals, such
as voice or music, are sampled and analyzed for frequencies. An important algorithm, in
this context, is the fast Fourier transform. This is discussed in Sec. 11.9.
Note that the two extensions of Fourier series are independent of each other and may
be studied in the order suggested in this chapter or by studying Fourier integrals and
transforms first and then Sturm–Liouville expansions.

Fourier Series
Fourier series are infinite series that represent periodic functions in terms of cosines and
sines. As such, Fourier series are of greatest importance to the engineer and applied
mathematician. To define Fourier series, we first need some background material.
A function f(x) is called a periodic function if f(x) is defined for all real x, except

possibly at some points, and if there is some positive number p, called a period of f(x),
such that
(1) f(x(cid:2)p)(cid:3)f(x) for all x.
(The function f(x)(cid:3)tan x is a periodic function that is not defined for all real x but
undefined for some points (more precisely, countably many points), that is x(cid:3)(cid:4)p 2,
(cid:4)3p 2,Á .) >

The graph of a periodic function has the characteristic that it can be obtained by periodic
repetition of its graph in any interval of length p (Fig. 258).
The smallest positive period is often called the fundamental period. (See Probs. 2–4.)
Familiar periodic functions are the cosine, sine, tangent, and cotangent. Examples of
functions that are not periodic are x, x2, x3, ex, cosh x, and ln x, to mention just a few.
If f(x) has period p, it also has the period 2p because (1) implies f(x(cid:2)2p)(cid:3)
f([x(cid:2)p](cid:2)p) (cid:3)f(x(cid:2)p)(cid:3)f(x), etc.; thus for any integer n(cid:3)1, 2, 3,Á ,
(2) f(x(cid:2)np)(cid:3)f(x) for all x.
Furthermore if f(x)and g(x)have period p, then af(x)(cid:2)bg(x)with any constants aand
b also has the period p.
Our problem in the first few sections of this chapter will be the representation of various
functions f(x) of period 2p in terms of the simple functions
(3) 1, cos x, sin x, cos 2x, sin
2x,Á
, cos nx, sin
nx,Á
.
All these functions have the period 2p. They form the so-called trigonometric system.
Figure 259 shows the first few of them (except for the constant 1, which is periodic with
any period).

The series to be obtained will be a trigonometric series, that is, a series of the form

a , a , b , a , b , are constants, called the coefficients of the series. We see that each
0 1 1 2 2
term has the period 2p. Hence if the coefficients are such that the series converges, its
sum will be a function of period 2p.
Expressions such as (4) will occur frequently in Fourier analysis. To compare the
expression on the right with that on the left, simply write the terms in the summation.
Convergence of one side implies convergence of the other and the sums will be the
same.
Now suppose that f(x) is a given function of period 2p and is such that it can be
representedby a series (4), that is, (4) converges and, moreover, has the sum f(x). Then,
using the equality sign, we write
(cid:3)
(5) f (x)(cid:3)a 0(cid:2) a(a

cos nx (cid:2)b

and call (5) the Fourier series of f(x). We shall prove that in this case the coefficients
of (5) are the so-called Fourier coefficients of f(x), given by the Euler formulas

The name “Fourier series” is sometimes also used in the exceptional case that (5) with
coefficients (6) does not converge or does not have the sum f(x)—this may happen but
is merely of theoretical interest. (For Euler see footnote 4 in Sec. 2.5.)
A Basic Example
Before we derive the Euler formulas (6), let us consider how (5) and (6) are applied in
this important basic example. Be fully alert, as the way we approach and solve this
example will be the technique you will use for other functions. Note that the integration
is a little bit different from what you are familiar with in calculus because of the n. Do
not just routinely use your software but try to get a good understanding and make
observations: How are continuous functions (cosines and sines) able to represent a given
discontinuous function? How does the quality of the approximation increase if you take
more and more terms of the series? Why are the approximating functions, called the
c11-a.qxd 10/30/10 1:24 PM Page 477
SEC. 11.1 Fourier Series 477
partial sums of the series, in this example always zero at 0 and p? Why is the factor
1 n (obtained in the integration) important?

EXAMPLE 1 Periodic Rectangular Wave (Fig. 260)
Find the Fourier coefficients of the periodic function f(x)in Fig. 260. The formula is

(7) f(x)(cid:3) and f(x(cid:2)2p)(cid:3)f(x).
k if 0(cid:6)x(cid:6)p
Functions of this kind occur as external forces acting on mechanical systems, electromotive forces in electric
b
circuits, etc. (The value of f(x)at a single point does not affect the integral; hence we can leave f(x)undefined
at x(cid:3)0and x(cid:3)(cid:4)p.)
Solution. From (6.0) we obtain a (cid:3)0. This can also be seen without integration, since the area under the
0
curve of f(x)between (cid:5)pand p(taken with a minus sign where f(x)is negative) is zero. From (6a) we obtain
the coefficients a , a ,Á of the cosine terms. Since f(x)is given by two expressions, the integrals from (cid:5)p

to psplit into two integrals:

because sin nx(cid:3)0at (cid:5)p, 0, and pfor all n(cid:3)1, 2,Á . We see that all these cosine coefficients are zero. That
is, the Fourier series of (7) has no cosine terms, just sine terms, it is a Fourier sine serieswith coefficients

Their graphs in Fig. 261 seem to indicate that the series is convergent and has the sum f(x), the given function.
We notice that at x(cid:3)0and x(cid:3)p, the points of discontinuity of f(x), all partial sums have the value zero, the
arithmetic mean of the limits (cid:5)kand kof our function, at these points. This is typical.

Derivation of the Euler Formulas (6)
The key to the Euler formulas (6) is the orthogonalityof (3), a concept of basic importance,
as follows. Here we generalize the concept of inner product (Sec. 9.3) to functions.
THEOREM 1 Orthogonality of the Trigonometric System (3)
The trigonometric system (3) is orthogonal on the interval (cid:5)p(cid:8)x(cid:8)p (hence
also on 0(cid:8)x(cid:8)2por any other interval of length 2pbecause of periodicity); that
is, the integral of the product of any two functions in (3) over that interval is 0, so
that for any integers n and m,

(c) sin nx cos mx dx (cid:3)0 (n(cid:7)m or n (cid:3)m).
(cid:2)p
PROOF This follows simply by transforming the integrands trigonometrically from products into
sums. In (9a) and (9b), by (11) in App. A3.1,
(cid:2)p 1(cid:2)p 1(cid:2)p

Hence division by 2pgives (6.0).
We prove (6a). Multiplying (5) on both sides by cos mxwith any fixedpositive integer

which is 0; an integral of a cos nx cos mx , which is a pfor n(cid:3)mand 0 for n(cid:7)mby
n m
(9a); and an integral of b sin nx cos mx, which is 0 for all n and m by (9c). Hence the
n
right side of (10) equals a p. Division by p gives (6a) (with m instead of n).
m
We finally prove (6b). Multiplying (5) on both sides by sin mxwith any fixedpositive
integer m and integrating from (cid:5)p to p, we get
(cid:2)p (cid:2)p (cid:3)
(11) f (x) sin mx dx (cid:3) a 0(cid:2) a (a n cos nx (cid:2)b n sin nx) sin mx dx.

Integrating term by term, we obtain on the right an integral of a sin mx, which is 0; an

integral of a cos nx sin mx, which is 0 by (9c); and an integral of b sin nx sin mx, which
n n
is b p if n(cid:3)m and 0 if n(cid:7)m, by (9b). This implies (6b) (with n denoted by m). This

completes the proof of the Euler formulas (6) for the Fourier coefficients. (cid:2)
Convergence and Sum of a Fourier Series
The class of functions that can be represented by Fourier series is surprisingly large and
general. Sufficient conditions valid in most applications are as follows.
THEOREM 2 Representation by a Fourier Series
Let f(x)be periodic with period 2pand piecewise continuous (see Sec. 6.1) in the
interval(cid:5)p(cid:8)x(cid:8)p. Furthermore, letf(x)have a left-hand derivative and a right-
hand derivative at each point of that interval. Then the Fourier series (5) of f(x)
[with coefficients (6)] converges. Its sum is f(x), except at points x where f(x) is
0
discontinuous. There the sum of the series is the average of the left- and right-hand
limits2 of f(x) at x .

SEC. 11.1 Fourier Series 481
PROOF We prove convergence, but only for a continuous function f(x) having continuous first
and second derivatives. And we do not prove that the sum of the series is f(x) because
these proofs are much more advanced; see, for instance, Ref. C12 listed in App. 1.

which is convergent. Hence that Fourier series converges and the proof is complete.
(Readers already familiar with uniform convergence will see that, by the Weierstrass
test in Sec. 15.5, under our present assumptions the Fourier series converges uniformly,
and our derivation of (6) by integrating term by term is then justified by Theorem 3 of
Sec. 15.5.) (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 2 Convergence at a Jump as Indicated in Theorem 2
The rectangular wave in Example 1 has a jump at x(cid:3)0. Its left-hand limit there is (cid:5)kand its right-hand limit
is k(Fig. 261). Hence the average of these limits is 0. The Fourier series (8) of the wave does indeed converge
to this value when x(cid:3)0because then all its terms are 0. Similarly for the other jumps. This is in agreement
(cid:2)
with Theorem 2.
Summary. A Fourier series of a given function f(x)of period 2pis a series of the form
(5) with coefficients given by the Euler formulas (6). Theorem 2 gives conditions that are
sufficient for this series to converge and at each x to have the value f(x), except at
discontinuities of f(x), where the series equals the arithmetic mean of the left-hand and
right-hand limits of f(x) at that point.

Half-Range Expansions
We now expand our initial basic discussion of Fourier series.
Orientation. This section concerns three topics:
1. Transition from period 2p to any period 2L, for the function f, simply by a
transformation of scale on the x-axis.
2. Simplifications. Only cosine terms if f is even (“Fourier cosine series”). Only sine
terms if f is odd (“Fourier sine series”).
3. Expansion of f given for 0(cid:8)x(cid:8)L in two Fourier series, one having only cosine
terms and the other only sine terms (“half-range expansions”).
1. From Period 2p to Any Period p (cid:3) 2L
Clearly, periodic functions in applications may have any period, not just 2pas in the last
section (chosen to have simple formulas). The notation p(cid:3)2Lfor the period is practical
because L will be a length of a violin string in Sec. 12.2, of a rod in heat conduction in
Sec. 12.5, and so on.
The transition from period 2p to be period p(cid:3)2Lis effected by a suitable change of
scale, as follows. Let f(x) have period p(cid:3)2L. Then we can introduce a new variable v
such that f(x), as a function of v, has period 2p. If we set
p 2p p
(1) (a) x(cid:3) v, so that (b) v(cid:3) x(cid:3) x
2p p L
then v(cid:3)(cid:4)p corresponds to x(cid:3)(cid:4)L. This means that f, as a function of v, has period
2p and, therefore, a Fourier series of the form

We could use these formulas directly, but the change to x simplifies calculations. Since
p p

and we integrate over x from (cid:5)L to L. Consequently, we obtain for a function f(x) of

And we can integrate from 0 to 2L or over any other interval of length p(cid:3)2L.

These formulas follow from (5) and (6) by remembering from calculus that the definite
integral gives the net area ((cid:3)area above the axis minus area below the axis) under the
curve of a function between the limits of integration. This implies
(cid:2)L (cid:2)L

(7) (cid:2)L 0

Formula (7b) implies the reduction to the cosine series (even fmakes f(x) sin (npx L)odd

since sin is odd) and to the sine series (odd fmakes f(x) cos (npx L)odd since cos is even).
>
Similarly, (7a) reduces the integrals in (6*)and (6**)to integrals from 0 to L. These reductions
are obvious from the graphs of an even and an odd function. (Give a formal proof.)

EXAMPLE 4 Fourier Cosine and Sine Series
The rectangular wave in Example 1 is even. Hence it follows without calculation that its Fourier series is a
Fourier cosine series, the b are all zero. Similarly, it follows that the Fourier series of the odd function in
n
Example 2 is a Fourier sine series.
In Example 3 you can see that the Fourier cosine series represents u(t)(cid:5)E p(cid:5)1E sin vt. Can you prove
> 2 (cid:2)
that this is an even function?
Further simplifications result from the following property, whose very simple proof is left
to the student.

3. Half-Range Expansions
Half-range expansions are Fourier series. The idea is simple and useful. Figure 270
explains it. We want to represent f(x) in Fig. 270.0 by a Fourier series, where f(x)
may be the shape of a distorted violin string or the temperature in a metal bar of length
L, for example. (Corresponding problems will be discussed in Chap. 12.) Now comes
the idea.
We could extend f(x)as a function of period Land develop the extended function into
a Fourier series. But this series would, in general, contain bothcosine andsine terms. We
can do better and get simpler series. Indeed, for our given f we can calculate Fourier
coefficients from (6*) or from (6**). And we have a choice and can take what seems
more practical. If we use (6*), we get (5*). This is the even periodic extension f of f
1
in Fig. 270a. If we choose (6**) instead, we get (5**), the odd periodic extension f of
2
f in Fig. 270b.
Both extensions have period 2L. This motivates the name half-range expansions: f is
given (and of physical interest) only on half the range, that is, on half the interval of
periodicity of length 2L.
Let us illustrate these ideas with an example that we shall also need in Chap. 12.

Forced Oscillations
Fourier series have important applications for both ODEs and PDEs. In this section we
shall focus on ODEs and cover similar applications for PDEs in Chap. 12. All these
applications will show our indebtedness to Euler’s and Fourier’s ingenious idea of splitting
up periodic functions into the simplest ones possible.
From Sec. 2.8 we know that forced oscillations of a body of mass m on a spring of
modulus k are governed by the ODE

where y(cid:3)y(t)is the displacement from rest, cthe damping constant, kthe spring constant
(spring modulus), and r(t) the external force depending on time t. Figure 274 shows the
model and Fig. 275 its electrical analog, an RLC-circuit governed by

We consider (1). If r(t) is a sine or cosine function and if there is damping (c(cid:10)0),
then the steady-state solution is a harmonic oscillation with frequency equal to that of r(t).
However, if r(t) is not a pure sine or cosine function but is any other periodic function,
then the steady-state solution will be a superposition of harmonic oscillations with
frequencies equal to that of r(t)and integer multiples of these frequencies. And if one of
these frequencies is close to the (practical) resonant frequency of the vibrating system (see
Sec.2.8), then the corresponding oscillation may be the dominant part of the response of
the system to the external force. This is what the use of Fourier series will show us. Of
course, this is quite surprising to an observer unfamiliar with Fourier series, which are
highly important in the study of vibrating systems and resonance. Let us discuss the entire
situation in terms of a typical example.

Approximation
by Trigonometric Polynomials
Fourier series play a prominent role not only in differential equations but also in
approximation theory, an area that is concerned with approximating functions by
other functions—usually simpler functions. Here is how Fourier series come into the
picture.
Let f(x) be a function on the interval (cid:5)p (cid:8)x(cid:8)p that can be represented on this
interval by a Fourier series. Then the Nth partial sum of the Fourier series
N
(1) f (x)(cid:3)a 0(cid:2) a(a
n
cos nx (cid:2)b
n
sin nx)
n(cid:3)1
is an approximation of the given f(x). In (1) we choose an arbitrary N and keep it fixed.
Then we ask whether (1) is the “best” approximation of fby a trigonometric polynomial
of the same degree N, that is, by a function of the form
N
(2) F (x)(cid:3)A 0(cid:2) a(A
n
cos nx (cid:2)B
n
sin nx) (N fixed).
n(cid:3)1
Here, “best” means that the “error” of the approximation is as small as possible.
Of course we must first define what we mean by the error of such an approximation.
We could choose the maximum of ƒf(x)(cid:5)F(x)ƒ. But in connection with Fourier series
it is better to choose a definition of error that measures the goodness of agreement between
fand Fon the whole interval(cid:5)p(cid:8)x(cid:8)p. This is preferable since the sum fof a Fourier
series may have jumps: Fin Fig. 278 is a good overall approximation of f, but the maximum
of ƒf(x)(cid:5)F(x)ƒ (more precisely, the supremum) is large. We choose

This is called the square errorof Frelative to the function fon the interval (cid:5)p(cid:8)x(cid:8)p.
Clearly, E(cid:9)0.
N being fixed, we want to determine the coefficients in (2) such that E is minimum.

We square (2), insert it into the last integral in (4), and evaluate the occurring integrals.
This gives integrals of cos2 nx and sin2 nx (n(cid:9)1), which equal p, and integrals of
cos nx, sin nx, and (cos nx)(sin mx), which are zero (just as in Sec. 11.1). Thus

THEOREM 1 Minimum Square Error
The square error of F in(2) (with fixed N) relative tofon the interval(cid:5)p(cid:8)x(cid:8)p
is minimum if and only if the coefficients of F in(2) are the Fourier coefficients off.
This minimum value E* is given by (6).
From (6) we see that E* cannot increase as N increases, but may decrease. Hence with
increasing N the partial sums of the Fourier series of f yield better and better approxi-
mations tof, considered from the viewpoint of the square error.
Since E*(cid:9)0 and (6) holds for every N, we obtain from (6) the important Bessel’s
inequality

Sturm–Liouville Problems.
Orthogonal Functions
The idea of the Fourier series was to represent general periodic functions in terms of
cosines and sines. The latter formed a trigonometric system. This trigonometric system
has the desirable property of orthogonality which allows us to compute the coefficient of
the Fourier series by the Euler formulas.
The question then arises, can this approach be generalized? That is, can we replace the
trigonometric system of Sec. 11.1 by other orthogonal systems (sets of other orthogonal
functions)? The answer is “yes” and will lead to generalized Fourier series, including the
Fourier–Legendre series and the Fourier–Bessel series in Sec. 11.6.
To prepare for this generalization, we first have to introduce the concept of a Sturm–
Liouville Problem. (The motivation for this approach will become clear as you read on.)
Consider a second-order ODE of the form

Here lis a parameter, and k , k , l , l are given real constants. Furthermore, at least one
1 2 1 2
of each constant in each condition (2) must be different from zero. (We will see in Example
1 that, if p(x)(cid:3)r(x)(cid:3)1and q(x)(cid:3)0, then sin 1lxand cos 1lxsatisfy (1) and constants
can be found to satisfy (2).) Equation (1) is known as a Sturm–Liouville equation.4
Together with conditions 2(a), 2(b) it is know as the Sturm–Liouville problem. It is an
example of a boundary value problem.
A boundary value problem consists of an ODE and given boundary conditions
referring to the two boundary points (endpoints) x(cid:3)a and x(cid:3)b of a given interval
a(cid:8)x(cid:8)b.
The goal is to solve these type of problems. To do so, we have to consider
Eigenvalues, Eigenfunctions
Clearly, y(cid:4)0 is a solution—the “trivial solution”—of the problem (1), (2) for any l
because (1) is homogeneous and (2) has zeros on the right. This is of no interest. We want
to find eigenfunctionsy(x), that is, solutions of (1) satisfying (2) without being identically
zero. We call a number lfor which an eigenfunction exists an eigenvalue of the Sturm–
Liouville problem (1), (2).
Many important ODEs in engineering can be written as Sturm–Liouville equations. The
following example serves as a case in point.
EXAMPLE 1 Trigonometric Functions as Eigenfunctions. Vibrating String
Find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Sturm–Liouville problem
(3) ys(cid:2)ly(cid:3)0, y(0)(cid:3)0, y(p)(cid:3)0.
This problem arises, for instance, if an elastic string (a violin string, for example) is stretched a little and fixed
at its ends x(cid:3)0and x(cid:3)pand then allowed to vibrate. Then y(x)is the “space function” of the deflection

4JACQUES CHARLES FRANÇOIS STURM (1803–1855) was born and studied in Switzerland and then
moved to Paris, where he later became the successor of Poisson in the chair of mechanics at the Sorbonne (the
University of Paris).
JOSEPH LIOUVILLE (1809–1882), French mathematician and professor in Paris, contributed to various
fields in mathematics and is particularly known by his important work in complex analysis (Liouville’s theorem;
Sec. 14.4), special functions, differential geometry, and number theory.

From the first boundary condition we obtain y(0)(cid:3)A(cid:3)0. The second boundary condition then yields
y(p)(cid:3)B sin (cid:12)p(cid:3)0, thus (cid:12)(cid:3)0, (cid:4) 1, (cid:4) 2, Á .
For (cid:12)(cid:3)0 we have y(cid:4)0. For l(cid:3)(cid:12)2(cid:3)1, 4, 9, 16,Á , taking B(cid:3)1, we obtain
y(x)(cid:3)sin (cid:12)x ((cid:12)(cid:3) 2l(cid:3)1, 2,Á ).
Hence the eigenvalues of the problem are l(cid:3)(cid:12)2, where (cid:12)(cid:3)1, 2, Á ,and corresponding eigenfunctions are
y(x)(cid:3)sin (cid:12)x, where (cid:12)(cid:3)1, 2 Á . (cid:2)
Note that the solution to this problem is precisely the trigonometric system of the Fourier
series considered earlier. It can be shown that, under rather general conditions on the
functions p,q,rin (1), the Sturm–Liouville problem (1), (2) has infinitely many eigenvalues.
The corresponding rather complicated theory can be found in Ref. [All] listed in App. 1.
r
Furthermore, if p, q, r, and p in (1) are real-valued and continuous on the interval
a(cid:8)x(cid:8)band ris positive throughout that interval (or negative throughout that interval),
then all the eigenvalues of the Sturm–Liouville problem (1), (2) are real. (Proof in App. 4.)
This is what the engineer would expect since eigenvalues are often related to frequencies,
energies, or other physical quantities that must be real.
The most remarkable and important property of eigenfunctions of Sturm–Liouville
problems is their orthogonality,which will be crucial in series developments in terms of
eigenfunctions, as we shall see in the next section. This suggests that we should next
consider orthogonal functions.

Theorem 1 shows that for any Sturm–Liouville problem, the eigenfunctions associated with
these problems are orthogonal. This means, in practice, if we can formulate a problem as a
Sturm–Liouville problem, then by this theorem we are guaranteed orthogonality.
THEOREM 1 Orthogonality of Eigenfunctions of Sturm–Liouville Problems
r
Suppose that the functions p, q, r, and p in the Sturm–Liouville equation (1) are
real-valued and continuous and r(x)(cid:10)0on the interval a(cid:8)x(cid:8)b. Let y (x)and
m
y (x) be eigenfunctions of the Sturm–Liouville problem (1), (2) that correspond to
n
different eigenvalues l and l , respectively. Then y , y are orthogonal on that
m n m n
interval with respect to the weight function r, that is,
(cid:2)b
(6) (y , y )(cid:3) r(x)y (x)y (x) dx (cid:3)0 (m(cid:7)n).
m n m n
a
If p(a)(cid:3)0, then (2a) can be dropped from the problem. If p(b) (cid:3)0, then (2b)
r
can be dropped. [It is then required that y and y remain bounded at such a point,
and the problem is called singular, as opposed to a regular problem in which (2)
is used.]
Ifp(a)(cid:3)p(b), then(2) can be replaced by the“periodic boundary conditions”
(7) y(a) (cid:3)y(b), yr (a) (cid:3)yr (b).
The boundary value problem consisting of the Sturm–Liouville equation (1) and the periodic
boundary conditions (7) is called a periodic Sturm–Liouville problem.

Case 1. p(a)(cid:6)p(b) (cid:6)0. Clearly, (9) is zero, and (2) is not needed.
Case 2. p(a)(cid:7)0, p(b) (cid:6)0. Line 1 of (9) is zero. Consider Line 2. From (2a) we have

by assumption, and the argument of proof is similar.
Case 3. p(a)(cid:6)0, p(b)(cid:7)0.Line 2 of (9) is zero. From (2b) it follows that Line 1 of (9)
is zero; this is similar to Case 2.
Case 4. p(a)(cid:7)0, p(b)(cid:7)0.We use both (2a) and (2b) and proceed as in Cases 2 and 3.
Case 5. p(a)(cid:6)p(b). Then (9) becomes

The expression in brackets [ ]is zero, either by (2) used as before, or more directly by

proof of Theorem 1. (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 3 Application of Theorem 1. Vibrating String
The ODE in Example 1 is a Sturm–Liouville equation with p(cid:3)1, q(cid:3)0, and r(cid:3)1. From Theorem 1 it follows
that the eigenfunctions y (cid:3)sin mx (m(cid:3)1, 2,Á )are orthogonal on the interval0(cid:8)x(cid:8)p. (cid:2)

SEC. 11.5 Sturm–Liouville Problems. Orthogonal Functions 503
Example 3 confirms, from this new perspective, that the trigonometric system underlying
the Fourier series is orthogonal, as we knew from Sec. 11.1.
EXAMPLE 4 Application of Theorem 1. Orthogonlity of the Legendre Polynomials
Legendre’s equation
(1(cid:5)x2)ys(cid:5)2xyr(cid:2)n(n(cid:2)1)y(cid:3)0may
be written
[(1(cid:5)x2)yr ]r(cid:2)ly(cid:3)0 l(cid:3)n(n(cid:2)1).
Hence, this is a Sturm–Liouville equation (1) with p(cid:3)1(cid:5)x2, q(cid:3)0, and r(cid:3)1. Since p((cid:5)1)(cid:3)p(1)(cid:3)0, we
need no boundary conditions, but have a“singular”Sturm–Liouville problem on the interval (cid:5)1(cid:8)x(cid:8)1. We
know that for n(cid:3)0, 1,Á , hence l(cid:3)0, 1 # 2, 2 # 3,Á , the Legendre polynomials P (x)are solutions of the
n
problem. Hence these are the eigenfunctions. From Theorem 1 it follows that they are orthogonal on that interval,
that is,
(cid:2)1
(10) P (x)P (x) dx(cid:3)0 (m(cid:7)n). (cid:2)

(cid:5)1
What we have seen is that the trigonometric system, underlying the Fourier series, is
a solution to a Sturm–Liouville problem, as shown in Example 1, and that this
trigonometric system is orthogonal, which we knew from Sec. 11.1 and confirmed in
Example 3.

Orthogonal Series.
Generalized Fourier Series
Fourier series are made up of the trigonometric system (Sec. 11.1), which is orthogonal,
and orthogonality was essential in obtaining the Euler formulas for the Fourier coefficients.
Orthogonality will also give us coefficient formulas for the desired generalized Fourier
series, including the Fourier–Legendre series and the Fourier–Bessel series. This gener-
alization is as follows.
Á
Let y , y , y , be orthogonal with respect to a weight function r(x) on an interval

If the y are the eigenfunctions of a Sturm–Liouville problem, we call (1) an eigenfunction

Bessel functions.
Given f(x), we have to determine the coefficients in (1), called the Fourier constants

justified, for instance, in the case of “uniform convergence,” as is shown in Sec. 15.5.)

Because of the orthogonality all the integrals on the right are zero, except when m(cid:3)n.
Hence the whole infinite series reduces to the single term

A graph would show that the curve of 1(cid:5)x2and that of the sum of first three terms practically coincide. (cid:2)
Mean Square Convergence. Completeness
Ideas on approximation in the last section generalize from Fourier series to orthogonal series
(1) that are made up of an orthonormal set that is “complete,” that is, consists of “sufficiently
many” functions so that (1) can represent large classes of other functions (definition below).
In this connection, convergence is convergence in the norm,also called mean-square
convergence; that is, a sequence of functions f is called convergent with the limit f if

We now define completeness. An orthonormal set y , y , Á on an interval a(cid:8)x(cid:8)b
0 1
is complete in a set of functions S defined on a(cid:8)x(cid:8)b if we can approximate every
f belonging to S arbitrarily closely in the norm by a linear combination a y (cid:2)

Ref. [GenRef7] in App. 1 uses the more modern term total for complete.
We can now extend the ideas in Sec. 11.4 that guided us from (3) in Sec. 11.4 to Bessel’s
and Parseval’s formulas (7) and (8) in that section. Performing the square in (13) and
using (14), we first have (analog of (4) in Sec. 11.4)

The first integral on the right equals ga2 because(cid:6)ry y dx (cid:3) 0 for m (cid:7) l, and
m m l

m m m
Hence the first term on the right cancels half of the second term, so that the right side
reduces to (analog of (6) in Sec. 11.4)

m(cid:3)0 a
This is nonnegative because in the previous formula the integrand on the left is nonnegative

important Bessel’s inequality (analog of (7) in Sec. 11.4)

Furthermore, if y , y , is complete in a set of functions S, then (13) holds for every f

belonging to S. By (13) this implies equality in (16) with k:(cid:13). Hence in the case of
completeness every fin Ssaisfies the so-called Parseval equality (analog of (8) in Sec. 11.4)

As a consequence of (18) we prove that in the case of completeness there is no function
orthogonal to every function of the orthonormal set, with the trivial exception of a function
of zero norm:
THEOREM 2 Completeness
Let y , y ,Á be a complete orthonormal set on a(cid:8)x(cid:8)b in a set of functions S.

Then if a function f belongs to S and is orthogonal to every y , it must have norm

zero. In particular, if f is continuous, then f must be identically zero.
PROOF Since f is orthogonal to every y , the left side of (18) must be zero. If f is continuous,
m
then (cid:5) f (cid:5)(cid:3)0implies f(x) (cid:4)0, as can be seen directly from (5) in Sec. 11.5 with f instead
of y because r(x)(cid:10)0 by assumption. (cid:2)

Fourier Integral
Fourier series are powerful tools for problems involving functions that are periodic or are of
interest on a finite interval only. Sections 11.2 and 11.3 first illustrated this, and various further
applications follow in Chap. 12. Since, of course, many problems involve functions that are
nonperiodicand are of interest on the whole x-axis,we ask what can be done to extend the
method of Fourier series to such functions. This idea will lead to “Fourier integrals.”
In Example 1 we start from a special function f of period 2Land see what happens to
L
its Fourier series if we let L:(cid:13). Then we do the same for an arbitrary function f of
L
period 2L. This will motivate and suggest the main result of this section, which is an
integral representation given in Theorem 1 below.
8CHARLES HERMITE (1822–1901), French mathematician, is known for his work in algebra and number
theory. The great HENRI POINCARÉ (1854–1912) was one of his students.

means establishes it; in fact, the limit of the series in (1) as ¢w approaches zero is not
the definition of the integral (3). Sufficient conditions for the validity of (5) are as follows.
THEOREM 1 Fourier Integral
If f(x)is piecewise continuous (see Sec. 6.1)in every finite interval and has a right-
hand derivative and a left-hand derivative at every point (see Sec 11.1) and if the
integral (2) exists, then f(x) can be represented by a Fourier integral (5) with A and
B given by (4). At a point where f(x) is discontinuous the value of the Fourier integral
equals the average of the left- and right-hand limits of f(x)at that point(see Sec. 11.1).
(Proof in Ref. [C12]; see App. 1.)
Applications of Fourier Integrals
The main application of Fourier integrals is in solving ODEs and PDEs, as we shall see
for PDEs in Sec. 12.6. However, we can also use Fourier integrals in integration and in
discussing functions defined by integrals, as the next example.

Figure 283 shows oscillations near the points of discontinuity of f(x). We might expect that these oscillations
disappear as aapproaches infinity. But this is not true; with increasing a, they are shifted closer to the points
x(cid:3)(cid:4)1. This unexpected behavior, which also occurs in connection with Fourier series (see Sec. 11.2), is known
as the Gibbs phenomenon. We can explain it by representing (9) in terms of sine integrals as follows. Using
(11) in App. A3.1, we have

0(cid:8)t(cid:8)(x(cid:5)1)a. Since sin ((cid:5)t)(cid:3)(cid:5)sin t, we thus obtain

and the oscillations in Fig. 283 result from those in Fig. 282. The increase of aamounts to a transformation
of the scale on the axis and causes the shift of the oscillations (the waves) toward the points of discontinuity
(cid:5)1and 1. (cid:2)
Fourier Cosine Integral and Fourier Sine Integral
Just as Fourier series simplify if a function is even or odd (see Sec. 11.2), so do Fourier
integrals, and you can save work. Indeed, if fhas a Fourier integral representation and is
even, then B(w) (cid:3)0 in (4). This holds because the integrand of B(w) is odd. Then (5)
reduces to a Fourier cosine integral
(cid:2)(cid:13)

Note the change in A(w): for even fthe integrand is even, hence the integral from (cid:5)(cid:13) to
(cid:13) equals twice the integral from 0 to (cid:13), just as in (7a) of Sec. 11.2.
Similarly, if f has a Fourier integral representation and is odd, then A(w)(cid:3)0in (4). This
is true because the integrand of A(w)is odd. Then (5) becomes a Fourier sine integral
(cid:2)(cid:13)

Note the change of B(w)to an integral from 0 to (cid:13) because B(w)is even (odd times odd
is even).
Earlier in this section we pointed out that the main application of the Fourier integral
representation is in differential equations. However, these representations also help in
evaluating integrals, as the following example shows for integrals from 0 to (cid:13).
EXAMPLE 3 Laplace Integrals
We shall derive the Fourier cosine and Fourier sine integrals of f(x)(cid:3)e(cid:2)kx, where x(cid:10)0and k(cid:10)0(Fig. 284).

Fourier Cosine and Sine Transforms
An integral transform is a transformation in the form of an integral that produces from
given functions new functions depending on a different variable. One is mainly interested
in these transforms because they can be used as tools in solving ODEs, PDEs, and integral
equations and can often be of help in handling and applying special functions. The Laplace
transform of Chap. 6 serves as an example and is by far the most important integral
transform in engineering.
Next in order of importance are Fourier transforms. They can be obtained from the
Fourier integral in Sec. 11.7 in a straightforward way. In this section we derive two such
transforms that are real, and in Sec. 11.9 a complex one.
Fourier Cosine Transform
The Fourier cosine transform concerns even functionsf(x).We obtain it from the Fourier
cosine integral [(10) in Sec. 10.7]

Namely, we set A(w)(cid:2) 22 p fˆ(w), where csuggests “cosine.” Then, writing v(cid:2)xin

the formula for A(w), we have

and
(cid:2)(cid:2)
(1b) f(x)(cid:2) 2 fˆ (w) cos wx dw.
p c
B
0
Formula (1a) gives from f(x) a new function fˆ(w), called the Fourier cosine transform
c
of f(x). Formula (1b) gives us back f(x)from fˆ(w),and we therefore call f(x)the inverse
c
Fourier cosine transform of fˆ(w).
c
The process of obtaining the transform fˆ from a given f is also called the Fourier
c
cosine transform or the Fourier cosine transform method.
Fourier Sine Transform
Similarly, in (11), Sec. 11.7, we set B(w)(cid:2) 22 p fˆ(w), where s suggests “sine.” Then,
> s
writing v(cid:2)x,we have from (11), Sec. 11.7, the Fourier sine transform, off(x)given by

What did we do to introduce the two integral transforms under consideration? Actually
not much: We changed the notations A and B to get a “symmetric” distribution of the
constant 2 p in the original formulas (1) and (2). This redistribution is a standard con-
>
venience, but it is not essential. One could do without it.
What have we gained? We show next that these transforms have operational properties
that permit them to convert differentiations into algebraic operations (just as the Laplace
transform does). This is the key to their application in solving differential equations.

Linearity, Transforms of Derivatives
If f(x) is absolutely integrable (see Sec. 11.7) on the positive x-axis and piecewise
continuous (see Sec. 6.1) on every finite interval, then the Fourier cosine and sine
transforms of f exist.
Furthermore, if f and g have Fourier cosine and sine transforms, so does af(cid:3)bg for
any constants a and b, and by (1a)

Fourier Transform.
Discrete and Fast Fourier Transforms
In Sec. 11.8 we derived two real transforms. Now we want to derive a complex transform
that is called the Fourier transform.It will be obtained from the complex Fourier integral,
which will be discussed next.
Complex Form of the Fourier Integral
The (real) Fourier integral is [see (4), (5), Sec. 11.7]

SEC. 11.9 Fourier Transform. Discrete and Fast Fourier Transforms 523
By the addition formula for the cosine [(6) in App. A3.1] the expression in the brackets
[Á ] equals cos (wv(cid:4)wx) or, since the cosine is even, cos (wx (cid:4)wv). We thus obtain
1
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
(1*) f(x)(cid:2) f(v) cos (wx(cid:4)wv)dv dw.
p
0 (cid:3)(cid:2)
The integral in brackets is an even function of w, call it F(w), because cos (wx(cid:4)wv) is
an even function of w, the function Bfdoes not depend on w, andR we integrate with respect
to v(not w). Hence the integral of F(w)from w(cid:2)0to (cid:6) is 1 times the integral of F(w)
2
from (cid:4)(cid:6) to (cid:6). Thus (note the change of the integration limit!)

(1) f(x)(cid:2) f(v) cos (wx(cid:4)wv) dv dw.

We claim that the integral of the form (1) with sin instead of cos is zero:

(2) f(v) sin (wx(cid:4)wv) dv dw(cid:2)0.
2p
(cid:3)(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:2)
This is true since sin (wx (cid:4)wv) is an odd function of w, which makes the integral in
brackets an odd function of wB, call it G(w). Hence the inRtegral of G(w) from (cid:4)(cid:6) to (cid:6)
is zero, as claimed.
We now take the integrand of (1) plus i ((cid:2) 1(cid:4)1) times the integrand of (2) and use
the Euler formula [(11) in Sec. 2.2]
(3) eix(cid:2)cos x (cid:3)i sin x.
Taking wx(cid:4)wv instead of x in (3) and multiplying by f(v) gives
f(v) cos (wx(cid:4)wv)(cid:3)if(v) sin (wx(cid:4)wv)(cid:2)f(v)ei(wx(cid:3)wv).
Hence the result of adding (1) plus i times (2), called the complex Fourier integral, is
1
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
(4) f(x)(cid:2) f(v)eiw(x(cid:3)v) dv dw (i(cid:2) 1(cid:4)1).

To obtain the desired Fourier transform will take only a very short step from here.

With this, (5) becomes

(cid:2)(cid:2)
(7) f(x)(cid:2) fˆ(w)eiwx dw

(cid:3)(cid:2)
and is called the inverse Fourier transform of fˆ(w).
Another notation for the Fourier transform is
fˆ(cid:2)f(f),
so that
f(cid:2)f(cid:3)1(fˆ).
The process of obtaining the Fourier transform f(f)(cid:2) fˆfrom a given fis also called
the Fourier transform or the Fourier transform method.
Using concepts defined in Secs. 6.1 and 11.7 we now state (without proof) conditions
that are sufficient for the existence of the Fourier transform.
THEOREM 1 Existence of the Fourier Transform
Iff(x)is absolutely integrable on the x-axis and piecewise continuous on every finite
interval, then the Fourier transform fˆ(w) of f(x) given by (6) exists.
EXAMPLE 1 Fourier Transform
Find the Fourier transform of f(x)(cid:2)1if ƒxƒ (cid:5)1and f(x)(cid:2)0otherwise.
Solution. Using (6) and integrating, we obtain
fˆ(w)(cid:2) 1 (cid:2)1 e(cid:3)iwx dx(cid:2) 1 # e(cid:3)iwx 1 (cid:2) 1 (e(cid:3)iw(cid:4)eiw).

As in (3) we have eiw(cid:2)cos w(cid:3)i sin w, e(cid:3)iw(cid:2)cos w(cid:4)i sin w,and by subtraction
eiw(cid:4)e(cid:3)iw(cid:2)2i sin w.
Substituting this in the previous formula on the right, we see that idrops out and we obtain the answer
fˆ(w)(cid:2) p sin w . (cid:2)

Solution. From the definition (6) we obtain by integration

Physical Interpretation: Spectrum
The nature of the representation (7) of f(x)becomes clear if we think of it as a superposition
of sinusoidal oscillations of all possible frequencies, called a spectral representation.
This name is suggested by optics, where light is such a superposition of colors
(frequencies). In (7), the “spectral density” fˆ(w) measures the intensity of f(x) in the
frequency interval between wand w(cid:3) ¢w(¢wsmall, fixed). We claim that, in connection
with vibrations, the integral
(cid:2)(cid:2)
ƒfˆ(w)ƒ2 dw
(cid:3)(cid:2)
can be interpreted as the total energyof the physical system. Hence an integral of ƒfˆ(w)ƒ2
from ato bgives the contribution of the frequencies wbetween aand bto the total energy.
To make this plausible, we begin with a mechanical system giving a single frequency,
namely, the harmonic oscillator (mass on a spring, Sec. 2.4)
mys (cid:3)ky(cid:2)0.

Hence the energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude ƒc ƒ.

As the next step, if a more complicated system leads to a periodic solution y(cid:2)f(x)
that can be represented by a Fourier series, then instead of the single energy term ƒc ƒ2
1
we get a series of squares ƒc ƒ2 of Fourier coefficients c given by (6), Sec. 11.4. In this
n n
case we have a “discrete spectrum” (or “point spectrum”) consisting of countably many
isolated frequencies (infinitely many, in general), the corresponding ƒc ƒ2 being the
n
contributions to the total energy.
Finally, a system whose solution can be represented by an integral (7) leads to the above
integral for the energy, as is plausible from the cases just discussed.

Linearity. Fourier Transform of Derivatives
New transforms can be obtained from given ones by using
THEOREM 2 Linearity of the Fourier Transform
The Fourier transform is a linear operation;that is, for any functions f(x)and g(x)

of af(cid:3)bg exists, and

In applying the Fourier transform to differential equations, the key property is that
differentiation of functions corresponds to multiplication of transforms by iw:
THEOREM 3 Fourier Transform of the Derivative of f(x)

Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT),
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
In using Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and trigonometric approximations (Sec. 11.6)
we have to assume that a function f(x),to be developed or transformed, is given on some
interval, over which we integrate in the Euler formulas, etc. Now very often a function f(x)
is given only in terms of values at finitely many points, and one is interested in extending
Fourier analysis to this case. The main application of such a “discrete Fourier analysis”
concerns large amounts of equally spaced data, as they occur in telecommunication, time
series analysis, and various simulation problems. In these situations, dealing with sampled
values rather than with functions, we can replace the Fourier transform by the so-called
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as follows.

by an idea similar to that in Sec. 11.1 for deriving the Fourier coefficients by using the
orthogonality of the trigonometric system. Instead of integrals we now take sums. Namely,
we multiply (16) by e(cid:3)imxk(note the minus!) and sum over kfrom 0 to N(cid:4)1.Then we
interchange the order of the two summations and insert x from (14). This gives
k

We donote [Á ] by r. For n(cid:2)m we have r(cid:2)e0(cid:2)1. The sum of these terms over k
equals N, the number of these terms. For n(cid:9)mwe have r(cid:9)1and by the formula for a

From the first matrix in (20) it is easy to infer what F looks like for arbitrary N, which in practice may be
N (cid:2)
1000 or more, for reasons given below.
From the DFT (the frequency spectrum) fˆ (cid:2) F f we can recreate the given signal

PROOF We prove (21). By the multiplication rule (row times column) the product matrix
G (cid:2)F F (cid:2)[g ] in (21a) has the entries g (cid:2)Row j of F times Column k of F .

That is, writing W(cid:2)wjwk, we prove that

Indeed, when j(cid:2)k, then wkwk(cid:2)(ww)k(cid:2)(e2pi >Ne(cid:3)2pi >N)k(cid:2)1k(cid:2)1, so that the sum
of these N terms equals N; these are the diagonal entries of G . Also, when j(cid:9)k, then

We have seen that fˆ is the frequency spectrum of the signal f(x). Thus the components
fˆ nof fˆgive a resolution of the 2p-periodic function f (x)into simple (complex) harmonics.
Here one should use only n’s that are much smaller than N 2, to avoid aliasing. By this
>
we mean the effect caused by sampling at too few (equally spaced) points, so that, for
instance, in a motion picture, rotating wheels appear as rotating too slowly or even in the
wrong sense. Hence in applications, Nis usually large. But this poses a problem. Eq. (18)
requires O(N) operations for any particular n, hence O(N2) operations for, say, all
n(cid:5)N 2. Thus, already for 1000 sample points the straightforward calculation would
>
involve millions of operations. However, this difficulty can be overcome by the so-called
fast Fourier transform (FFT), for which codes are readily available (e.g., in Maple). The
FFT is a computational method for the DFT that needs only O(N) log N operations
2
insteadof O(N2). It makes the DFT a practical tool for large N. Here one chooses N(cid:2)2p
(pinteger) and uses the special form of the Fourier matrix to break down the given problem
into smaller problems. For instance, when N(cid:2)1000, those operations are reduced by a
factor 1000 log 1000(cid:3)100.
> 2
The breakdown produces two problems of size M(cid:2)N 2. This breakdown is possible
>
because for N (cid:2)2M we have in (19)
w N2 (cid:2)w 22
M
(cid:2)(e(cid:3)2pi >N)2(cid:2)e(cid:3)4pi >(2M)(cid:2)e(cid:3)2pi >(M)(cid:2)w M.
The given vector f(cid:2)[f Á f ]T is split into two vectors with M components each,
0 N(cid:3)1
namely, f (cid:2)[f f Á f ]T containing the even components of f, and f (cid:2)

For N(cid:2)2pthis breakdown can be repeated p(cid:4)1times in order to finally arrive at N 2

above.
We show the reduction from N(cid:2)4 to M (cid:2)N 2(cid:2)2 and then prove (22).

When N(cid:2)4, then w(cid:2)w N(cid:2)(cid:4)ias in Example 4 and M(cid:2)N >2(cid:2)2, hence w(cid:2)w M(cid:2)e(cid:3)2pi >2(cid:2)e(cid:3)pi(cid:2)(cid:4)1.

We prove (22). From (18) and (19) we have for the components of the DFT

Formula (22a) is the same as (23). In (22b) we have n(cid:3)M instead of n. This causes
a sign changes in (23), namely (cid:4)wn before the second sum because
N
w NM(cid:2)e(cid:3)2piM >N(cid:2)e(cid:3)2pi >2 (cid:2)e(cid:3)pi(cid:2)(cid:4)1.
This gives the minus in (22b) and completes the proof. (cid:2)

Fourier series are fundamental in connection with periodic phenomena, particularly
in models involving differential equations (Sec. 11.3, Chap, 12). If f(x) is even
[f((cid:4)x)(cid:2)f(x)]or odd [f((cid:4)x)(cid:2)(cid:4)f(x)], they reduce to Fourier cosine or Fourier
sine series, respectively (Sec. 11.2). If f(x) is given for 0(cid:10)x(cid:10)L only, it has two
half-range expansionsof period 2L, namely, a cosine and a sine series (Sec. 11.2).
The set of cosine and sine functions in (1) is called the trigonometric system.
Its most basic property is its orthogonality on an interval of length 2L; that is, for
all integers m and n(cid:9)m we have
(cid:2)L mpx npx (cid:2)L mpx npx

and for all integers m and n,

This orthogonality was crucial in deriving the Euler formulas (2).

Summary of Chapter 11 539
Partial sums of Fourier series minimize the square error (Sec. 11.4).
Replacing the trigonometric system in (1) by other orthogonal systems first leads
to Sturm–Liouville problems (Sec. 11.5), which are boundary value problems for
ODEs. These problems are eigenvalue problems and as such involve a parameter
lthat is often related to frequencies and energies. The solutions to Sturm–Liouville
problems are called eigenfunctions. Similar considerations lead to other orthogonal
series such as Fourier–Legendre series and Fourier–Bessel series classified as
generalized Fourier series (Sec. 11.6).
Ideas and techniques of Fourier series extend to nonperiodic functions f(x)defined
on the entire real line; this leads to the Fourier integral

Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs)
A PDE is an equation that contains one or more partial derivatives of an unknown function
that depends on at least two variables. Usually one of these deals with time t and the
remaining with space (spatial variable(s)). The most important PDEs are the wave
equations that can model the vibrating string (Secs. 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.12) and the
vibrating membrane (Secs. 12.8, 12.9, 12.10), the heat equation for temperature in a bar
or wire (Secs. 12.5, 12.6), and the Laplace equation for electrostatic potentials (Secs.
12.6, 12.10, 12.11). PDEs are very important in dynamics, elasticity, heat transfer,
electromagnetic theory, and quantum mechanics. They have a much wider range of
applications than ODEs, which can model only the simplest physical systems. Thus PDEs
are subjects of many ongoing research and development projects.
Realizing that modeling with PDEs is more involved than modeling with ODEs, we
take a gradual, well-planned approach to modeling with PDEs. To do this we carefully
derive the PDE that models the phenomena, such as the one-dimensional wave equation
for a vibrating elastic string (say a violin string) in Sec. 12.2, and then solve the PDE
in a separate section, that is, Sec. 12.3. In a similar vein, we derive the heat equation in
Sec. 12.5 and then solve and generalize it in Sec. 12.6.
We derive these PDEs from physics and consider methods for solving initial and
boundary value problems, that is, methods of obtaining solutions which satisfy the
conditions required by the physical situations. In Secs. 12.7 and 12.12 we show how PDEs
can also be solved by Fourier and Laplace transform methods.
COMMENT. Numerics for PDEs is explained in Secs. 21.4–21.7, which, for greater
teaching flexibility, is designed to be independent of the other sections on numerics in
Part E.

Basic Concepts of PDEs
A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation involving one or more partial
derivatives of an (unknown) function, call it u, that depends on two or more variables,
often time t and one or several variables in space. The order of the highest derivative is
called the order of the PDE. Just as was the case for ODEs, second-order PDEs will be
the most important ones in applications.

SEC. 12.1 Basic Concepts of PDEs 541
Just as for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) we say that a PDE is linear if it is
of the first degree in the unknown function u and its partial derivatives. Otherwise we
call it nonlinear. Thus, all the equations in Example 1 are linear. We call a linear PDE
homogeneous if each of its terms contains either u or one of its partial derivatives.
Otherwise we call the equation nonhomogeneous. Thus, (4) in Example 1 (with f not
identically zero) is nonhomogeneous, whereas the other equations are homogeneous.

A solution of a PDE in some region R of the space of the independent variables is a
function that has all the partial derivatives appearing in the PDE in some domain D
(definition in Sec. 9.6) containing R, and satisfies the PDE everywhere in R.
Often one merely requires that the function is continuous on the boundary of R, has
those derivatives in the interior of R, and satisfies the PDE in the interior of R. Letting R
lie in Dsimplifies the situation regarding derivatives on the boundary of R, which is then
the same on the boundary as it is in the interior of R.
In general, the totality of solutions of a PDE is very large. For example, the functions
(7) u(cid:2)x2 (cid:4)y2, u(cid:2)ex cos y, u(cid:2)sin x cosh y, u(cid:2)ln (x2(cid:3)y2)
which are entirely different from each other, are solutions of (3), as you may verify. We
shall see later that the unique solution of a PDE corresponding to a given physical problem
will be obtained by the use of additional conditionsarising from the problem. For instance,
this may be the condition that the solution uassume given values on the boundary of the
region R(“boundary conditions”). Or, when time tis one of the variables, u(or u (cid:2) 0u 0t
t >
or both) may be prescribed at t(cid:2)0 (“initial conditions”).
We know that if an ODE is linear and homogeneous, then from known solutions we
can obtain further solutions by superposition. For PDEs the situation is quite similar:
THEOREM 1 Fundamental Theorem on Superposition
If u and u are solutions of a homogeneous linear PDE in some region R, then

and is left to the student.
Verification of solutions in Probs. 2–13 proceeds as for ODEs. Problems 16–23 concern
PDEs solvable like ODEs. To help the student with them, we consider two typical examples.

Modeling: Vibrating String, Wave Equation
In this section we model a vibrating string, which will lead to our first important PDE,
that is, equation (3) which will then be solved in Sec. 12.3. The student should pay very
close attention to this delicate modeling process and detailed derivation starting from
scratch, as the skills learned can be applied to modeling other phenomena in general and
in particular to modeling a vibrating membrane (Sec. 12.7).
We want to derive the PDE modeling small transverse vibrations of an elastic string, such
as a violin string. We place the string along the x-axis, stretch it to length L, and fasten it
at the ends x(cid:2)0and x(cid:2)L.We then distort the string, and at some instant, call it t(cid:2)0,
we release it and allow it to vibrate. The problem is to determine the vibrations of the string,
that is, to find its deflection u(x, t)at any point xand at any time t(cid:5)0;see Fig. 286.
u(x, t) will be the solution of a PDE that is the model of our physical system to be
derived. This PDE should not be too complicated, so that we can solve it. Reasonable
simplifying assumptions (just as for ODEs modeling vibrations in Chap. 2) are as follows.
Physical Assumptions
1. The mass of the string per unit length is constant (“homogeneous string”). The string
is perfectly elastic and does not offer any resistance to bending.
2. The tension caused by stretching the string before fastening it at the ends is so large
that the action of the gravitational force on the string (trying to pull the string down
a little) can be neglected.
3. The string performs small transverse motions in a vertical plane; that is, every
particle of the string moves strictly vertically and so that the deflection and the slope
at every point of the string always remain small in absolute value.
Under these assumptions we may expect solutions u(x, t) that describe the physical
reality sufficiently well.

Derivation of the PDE of the Model
(“Wave Equation”) from Forces
The model of the vibrating string will consist of a PDE (“wave equation”) and additional
conditions. To obtain the PDE, we consider the forces acting on a small portion of the
string (Fig. 286). This method is typical of modeling in mechanics and elsewhere.
Since the string offers no resistance to bending, the tension is tangential to the curve
of the string at each point. Let T and T be the tension at the endpoints P and Q of that
1 2
portion. Since the points of the string move vertically, there is no motion in the horizontal
direction. Hence the horizontal components of the tension must be constant. Using the
notation shown in Fig. 286, we thus obtain
(1) T cos a (cid:2)T cos b(cid:2)T(cid:2)const.
1 2
In the vertical direction we have two forces, namely, the vertical components (cid:4)T sin a
1
and T sin b of T and T; here the minus sign appears because the component at P is
2 1 2
directed downward. By Newton’s second law(Sec. 2.4) the resultant of these two forces
is equal to the mass r¢xof the portion times the acceleration 02u 0t2, evaluated at some
>
point between xand x(cid:3) ¢x; here ris the mass of the undeflected string per unit length,
and ¢xis the length of the portion of the undeflected string. (¢is generally used to denote
small quantities; this has nothing to do with the Laplacian (cid:6)2, which is sometimes also
denoted by ¢.) Hence
02u

Using (1), we can divide this by T cos b(cid:2)T cos a (cid:2)T, obtaining

that this constant is positive,a fact that will be essential to the form of the solutions. “One-
dimensional” means that the equation involves only one space variable, x. In the next
section we shall complete setting up the model and then show how to solve it by a general
method that is probably the most important one for PDEs in engineering mathematics.
12.3
Solution by Separating Variables.
Use of Fourier Series
We continue our work from Sec. 12.2, where we modeled a vibrating string and obtained
the one-dimensional wave equation. We now have to complete the model by adding
additional conditions and then solving the resulting model.
The model of a vibrating elastic string (a violin string, for instance) consists of the one-
dimensional wave equation
02u 02u T
(1) (cid:2)c2 c2(cid:2)

for the unknown deflection u(x, t) of the string, a PDE that we have just obtained, and
some additional conditions, which we shall now derive.
Since the string is fastened at the ends x(cid:2)0 and x(cid:2)L (see Sec. 12.2), we have the
two boundary conditions
(2) (a) u(0, t) (cid:2)0, (b) u(L, t)(cid:2)0, for all t (cid:8)0.
Furthermore, the form of the motion of the string will depend on its initial deflection
(deflection at time t(cid:2)0), call it f(x),and on its initial velocity(velocity at t(cid:2)0), call it
g(x). We thus have the two initial conditions

where u (cid:2) 0u 0t.We now have to find a solution of the PDE (1) satisfying the conditions
t >
(2) and (3). This will be the solution of our problem. We shall do this in three steps, as
follows.
Step 1. By the “method of separating variables” or product method, setting
u(x, t)(cid:2)F(x)G(t), we obtain from (1) two ODEs, one for F(x) and the other one
for G(t).
Step 2. We determine solutions of these ODEs that satisfy the boundary conditions (2).
Step 3. Finally, using Fourier series, we compose the solutions found in Step 2 to obtain
a solution of (1) satisfying both (2) and (3), that is, the solution of our model of the
vibrating string.
Step 1. Two ODEs from the Wave Equation (1)
In the method of separating variables, or product method, we determine solutions of the
wave equation (1) of the form
(4) u(x, t)(cid:2)F(x)G(t)
c12-a.qxd 10/30/10 1:44 PM Page 546
546 CHAP. 12 Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
which are a product of two functions, each depending on only one of the variables xand t.
This is a powerful general method that has various applications in engineering mathematics,
as we shall see in this chapter. Differentiating (4), we obtain
##

(cid:2)FG and
02u
(cid:2)Fs G

where dots denote derivatives with respect to t and primes derivatives with respect to x.

##

Dividing by c2FG and simplifying gives
##
s
G F
(cid:2) .
c2G F
The variables are now separated, the left side depending only on tand the right side only
on x. Hence both sides must be constant because, if they were variable, then changing t
or x would affect only one side, leaving the other unaltered. Thus, say,
##
s

(cid:2) (cid:2)k.

Multiplying by the denominators gives immediately two ordinary DEs
(5) Fs (cid:4)kF(cid:2)0
and
##
(6) G(cid:4)c2kG(cid:2)0.
Here, the separation constant k is still arbitrary.
Step 2. Satisfying the Boundary Conditions (2)
We now determine solutions Fand Gof (5) and (6) so that u(cid:2)FGsatisfies the boundary
conditions (2), that is,
(7) u(0, t) (cid:2)F(0)G(t)(cid:2)0, u(L, t)(cid:2)F(L)G(t)(cid:2)0 for all t.
We first solve (5). If G(cid:3)0, then u(cid:2)FG(cid:3)0, which is of no interest. Hence G [ 0
and then by (7),
(8) (a) F(0) (cid:2)0, (b) F(L) (cid:2)0.
We show that k must be negative. For k(cid:2)0 the general solution of (5) is F(cid:2)ax(cid:3)b,
and from (8) we obtain a(cid:2)b(cid:2)0,so that F(cid:3)0and u(cid:2)FG(cid:3)0,which is of no interest.
For positive k(cid:2)(cid:2)2 a general solution of (5) is
F(cid:2)Ae(cid:2)x(cid:3)Be(cid:2)(cid:2)x

SEC. 12.3 Solution by Separating Variables. Use of Fourier Series 547
and from (8) we obtain F(cid:3)0 as before (verify!). Hence we are left with the possibility
of choosing k negative, say, k(cid:2)(cid:4)p2. Then (5) becomes Fs (cid:3)p2F(cid:2)0 and has as a
general solution
F(x)(cid:2)A cos px (cid:3)B sin px.
From this and (8) we have
F(0) (cid:2)A(cid:2)0 and then F(L) (cid:2)B sin pL (cid:2)0.
We must take B(cid:9)0 since otherwise F(cid:3)0. Hence sin pL (cid:2)0. Thus

the nth normal mode has n(cid:4)1 nodes, that is, points of the string that do not move (in
addition to the fixed endpoints); see Fig. 287.

Figure 288 shows the second normal mode for various values of t. At any instant the
string has the form of a sine wave. When the left part of the string is moving down, the
other half is moving up, and conversely. For the other modes the situation is similar.
Tuningis done by changing the tension T. Our formula for the frequency l 2p (cid:2)cn 2L

frequency is proportional to the tension. T cannot be increased indefinitely, but can you
see what to do to get a string with a high fundamental mode? (Think of both L and r.)

Step 3. Solution of the Entire Problem. Fourier Series
The eigenfunctions (11) satisfy the wave equation (1) and the boundary conditions (2)
(string fixed at the ends). A single u will generally not satisfy the initial conditions (3).
n
But since the wave equation (1) is linear and homogeneous, it follows from Fundamental
Theorem 1 in Sec. 12.1 that the sum of finitely many solutions u is a solution of (1). To
n
obtain a solution that also satisfies the initial conditions (3), we consider the infinite series

Result. Our discussion shows that u(x, t) given by (12) with coefficients (14) and (15)
is a solution of (1) that satisfies all the conditions in (2) and (3), provided the series (12)
converges and so do the series obtained by differentiating (12) twice termwise with respect
to x and t and have the sums 02u 0x2 and 02u 0t2, respectively, which are continuous.

Solution (12) Established. According to our derivation, the solution (12) is at first a
purely formal expression, but we shall now establish it. For the sake of simplicity we
consider only the case when the initial velocity g(x) is identically zero. Then the B* are

where f*is the odd periodic extension of fwith the period 2L(Fig. 289). Since the initial
deflection f(x)is continuous on the interval 0(cid:7)x(cid:7)Land zero at the endpoints, it follows
from (17) that u(x, t) is a continuous function of both variables x and t for all values of
the variables. By differentiating (17) we see that u(x, t)is a solution of (1), provided f(x)
is twice differentiable on the interval 0(cid:10)x(cid:10)L, and has one-sided second derivatives at
x(cid:2)0and x(cid:2)L,which are zero. Under these conditions u(x, t)is established as a solution
of (1), satisfying (2) and (3) with g(x) (cid:3)0. (cid:2)

Generalized Solution. If f (x)and f (x)are merely piecewise continuous (see Sec. 6.1),
or if those one-sided derivatives are not zero, then for each t there will be finitely many
values of x at which the second derivatives of u appearing in (1) do not exist. Except at
these points the wave equation will still be satisfied. We may then regard u(x, t) as a
“generalized solution,” as it is called, that is, as a solution in a broader sense. For instance,
a triangular initial deflection as in Example 1 (below) leads to a generalized solution.
Physical Interpretation of the Solution (17). The graph of f*(x(cid:4)ct)is obtained from
the graph of f*(x) by shifting the latter ct units to the right (Fig. 290). This means that
f*(x(cid:4)ct)(c(cid:5)0)represents a wave that is traveling to the right as tincreases. Similarly,
f*(x(cid:3)ct) represents a wave that is traveling to the left, and u(x, t) is the superposition
of these two waves.

It is interesting that the solution (17), Sec. 12.3, of the wave equation
02u 02u T
(1) (cid:2)c2 , c2(cid:2) ,
0t2 0x2 r
can be immediately obtained by transforming (1) in a suitable way, namely, by introducing
the new independent variables
(2) v(cid:2)x(cid:3)ct, w(cid:2)x(cid:4)ct.
Then ubecomes a function of vand w. The derivatives in (1) can now be expressed in terms
of derivatives with respect to v and w by the use of the chain rule in Sec. 9.6. Denoting
partial derivatives by subscripts, we see from (2) that v (cid:2)1 and w (cid:2)1. For simplicity
x x
let us denote u(x, t),as a function of vand w, by the same letter u. Then
u (cid:2)u v (cid:3)u w (cid:2)u (cid:3)u .
x v x w x v w
We now apply the chain rule to the right side of this equation. We assume that all the
partial derivatives involved are continuous, so that u (cid:2)u .Since v (cid:2)1and w (cid:2)1,
wv vw x x
we obtain
u (cid:2)(u (cid:3)u ) (cid:2)(u (cid:3)u ) v (cid:3)(u (cid:3)u ) w (cid:2)u (cid:3)2u (cid:3)u .
xx v w x v w v x v w w x vv vw ww
Transforming the other derivative in (1) by the same procedure, we find
u (cid:2)c2(u (cid:4)2u (cid:3)u ).
tt vv vw ww
By inserting these two results in (1) we get (see footnote 2 in App. A3.2)
02u
(3) u (cid:3) (cid:2)0.
vw 0w 0v
The point of the present method is that (3) can be readily solved by two successive
integrations, first with respect to w and then with respect to v. This gives
0u (cid:2)
(cid:2)h(v) and u(cid:2) h(v)dv(cid:3)c(w).
0v
c12-a.qxd 10/30/10 1:44 PM Page 554
554 CHAP. 12 Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
Here h(v)and c(w)are arbitrary functions of vand w, respectively. Since the integral is
a function of v, say, (cid:3)(v), the solution is of the form u(cid:2)(cid:3)(v)(cid:3)c(w). In terms of x
and t, by (2), we thus have
(4) u(x, t)(cid:2)(cid:3)(x(cid:3)ct)(cid:3)c(x(cid:4)ct).
This is known as d’Alembert’s solution1 of the wave equation (1).
Its derivation was much more elegant than the method in Sec. 12.3, but d’Alembert’s method
is special, whereas the use of Fourier series applies to various equations, as we shall see.

where primes denote derivatives with respect to the entire arguments x(cid:3)ct and x(cid:4)ct,
respectively, and the minus sign comes from the chain rule. From (4)–(6) we have

(8) u (x, 0) (cid:2)c(cid:3)r (x) (cid:3)ccr (x) (cid:2)g(x).

If the initial velocity is zero, we see that this reduces to
(13) u(x, t)(cid:2)1[f(x(cid:3)ct)(cid:3)f(x(cid:4)ct)],
2
in agreement with (17) in Sec. 12.3. You may show that because of the boundary conditions
(2) in that section the function f must be odd and must have the period 2L.
Our result shows that the two initial conditions [the functions f(x) and g(x) in (5)]
determine the solution uniquely.
The solution of the wave equation by the Laplace transform method will be shown in
Sec. 12.11.
Characteristics. Types and Normal Forms of PDEs
The idea of d’Alembert’s solution is just a special instance of the method of characteristics.
This concerns PDEs of the form
(14) Au (cid:3)2Bu (cid:3)Cu (cid:2)F(x, y, u, u , u )
xx xy yy x y
(as well as PDEs in more than two variables). Equation (14) is called quasilinearbecause
it is linear in the highest derivatives (but may be arbitrary otherwise). There are three
types of PDEs (14), depending on the discriminant AC(cid:4)B2, as follows.
Type Defining Condition Example in Sec. 12.1
Hyperbolic AC(cid:4)B2(cid:10)0 Wave equation (1)
Parabolic AC(cid:4)B2(cid:2)0 Heat equation (2)
Elliptic AC(cid:4)B2(cid:5)0 Laplace equation (3)
Note that (1) and (2) in Sec. 12.1 involve t, but to have y as in (14), we set y(cid:2)ct in
(1), obtaining u (cid:4)c2u (cid:2)c2(u (cid:4)u )(cid:2)0. And in (2) we set y(cid:2)c2t, so that
tt xx yy xx
u (cid:4)c2u (cid:2)c2(u (cid:4)u ).
t xx y xx
A, B, Cmay be functions of x, y, so that a PDE may be of mixed type, that is, of different
type in different regions of the xy-plane. An important mixed-type PDE is the Tricomi
equation(see Prob. 10).
Transformation of (14) to Normal Form. The normal forms of (14) and the correspond-
ing transformations depend on the type of the PDE. They are obtained by solving the
characteristic equationof (14), which is the ODE
(15) Ayr2(cid:4)2Byr (cid:3)C(cid:2)0
where yr (cid:2)dy dx(note (cid:4)2B,not (cid:3)2B). The solutions of (15) are called the characteristics
>
of (14), and we write them in the form £(x, y) (cid:2)const and °(x, y) (cid:2)const. Then the
transformations giving new variables v, winstead of x, yand the normal forms of (14) are
as follows.

The theory of characteristics gives d’Alembert’s solution in a systematic fashion. To see this, we write the wave

12.5
Modeling: Heat Flow from a Body
in Space. Heat Equation
After the wave equation (Sec. 12.2) we now derive and discuss the next “big” PDE, the
heat equation, which governs the temperature uin a body in space. We obtain this model
of temperature distribution under the following.
Physical Assumptions
1. The specific heat s and the density r of the material of the body are constant. No
heat is produced or disappears in the body.
2. Experiments show that, in a body, heat flows in the direction of decreasing
temperature, and the rate of flow is proportional to the gradient (cf. Sec. 9.7) of the
temperature; that is, the velocity v of the heat flow in the body is of the form
(1) v(cid:2)(cid:4)K grad u
where u(x, y, z, t) is the temperature at a point (x, y, z) and time t.
3. The thermal conductivity Kis constant, as is the case for homogeneous material and
nonextreme temperatures.
Under these assumptions we can model heat flow as follows.
Let T be a region in the body bounded by a surface S with outer unit normal vector n
such that the divergence theorem (Sec. 10.7) applies. Then
v•n
is the component of vin the direction of n. Hence ƒv•n ¢Aƒ is the amount of heat leaving
T (if v•n(cid:5)0 at some point P) or entering T (if v•n(cid:10)0 at P) per unit time at some
point Pof Sthrough a small portion ¢Sof Sof area ¢A. Hence the total amount of heat
that flows across S from T is given by the surface integral
(cid:2)(cid:2)
v•n dA.
S
Note that, so far, this parallels the derivation on fluid flow in Example 1 of Sec. 10.8.
Using Gauss’s theorem (Sec. 10.7), we now convert our surface integral into a volume
integral over the region T. Because of (1) this gives [use (3) in Sec. 9.8]
(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)

On the other hand, the total amount of heat in T is

This must be equal to the amount of heat leaving T because no heat is produced or

This is the heat equation, the fundamental PDE modeling heat flow. It gives the

As an important application of the heat equation, let us first consider the temperature
in a long thin metal bar or wire of constant cross section and homogeneous material, which
is oriented along the x-axis (Fig. 294) and is perfectly insulated laterally, so that heat flows
in the x-direction only. Then besides time, u depends only on x, so that the Laplacian

This PDE seems to differ only very little from the wave equation, which has a term u
tt
instead of u , but we shall see that this will make the solutions of (1) behave quite
t
differently from those of the wave equation.
We shall solve (1) for some important types of boundary and initial conditions. We
begin with the case in which the ends x(cid:2)0and x(cid:2)Lof the bar are kept at temperature
zero, so that we have the boundary conditions
(2) u(0, t) (cid:2)0, u(L, t)(cid:2)0 for all t (cid:8)0.
Furthermore, the initial temperature in the bar at time t(cid:2)0is given, say, f(x),so that we
have the initial condition
(3) u(x, 0) (cid:2)f(x) [f(x) given].
Here we must have f(0) (cid:2)0 and f(L) (cid:2)0 because of (2).
We shall determine a solution u(x, t)of (1) satisfying (2) and (3)—one initial condition
will be enough, as opposed to two initial conditions for the wave equation. Technically,
our method will parallel that for the wave equation in Sec. 12.3: a separation of variables,
followed by the use of Fourier series. You may find a step-by-step comparison
worthwhile.

The left side depends only on tand the right side only on x, so that both sides must equal
a constant k (as in Sec. 12.3). You may show that for k(cid:2)0 or k(cid:5)0 the only solution
u(cid:2)FG satisfying (2) is u(cid:3)0. For negative k(cid:2)(cid:4)p2 we have from (4)

Step 2.Satisfying the boundary conditions (2). We first solve (5). A general solution is

From the boundary conditions (2) it follows that
u(0, t) (cid:2)F(0)G(t)(cid:2)0 and u(L, t)(cid:2)F(L)G(t)(cid:2)0.
Since G(cid:3)0 would give u(cid:3)0, we require F(0) (cid:2)0, F(L) (cid:2)0 and get F(0) (cid:2)A(cid:2)0
by (7) and then F(L) (cid:2)B sin pL (cid:2)0, with B(cid:9)0 (to avoid F(cid:3)0); thus,

Because of the exponential factor, all the terms in (9) approach zero as t approaches

Find a solution formula of (1), (3) with (2) replaced by the condition that both ends of the bar are insulated.
Solution. Physical experiments show that the rate of heat flow is proportional to the gradient of the
temperature. Hence if the ends x(cid:2)0and x(cid:2)Lof the bar are insulated, so that no heat can flow through the
ends, we have grad u(cid:2)u (cid:2)0u 0xand the boundary conditions

R of the xy-plane and a given boundary condition on the boundary curve C of R. This is
a boundary value problem (BVP). One calls it:

Unifying Power of Methods. Electrostatics, Elasticity
The Laplace equation (14) also governs the electrostatic potential of electrical charges in any
region that is free of these charges. Thus our steady-state heat problem can also be interpreted
as an electrostatic potential problem. Then (17), (18) is the potential in the rectangle Rwhen
the upper side of Ris at potential f(x)and the other three sides are grounded.
Actually, in the steady-state case, the two-dimensional wave equation (to be considered
in Secs. 12.8, 12.9) also reduces to (14). Then (17), (18) is the displacement of a rectangular
elastic membrane (rubber sheet, drumhead) that is fixed along its boundary, with three
sides lying in the xy-plane and the fourth side given the displacement f(x).
This is another impressive demonstration of the unifying power of mathematics. It
illustrates that entirely different physical systems may have the same mathematical model
and can thus be treated by the same mathematical methods.

Heat Equation: Modeling Very Long Bars.
Solution by Fourier Integrals and
Transforms
Our discussion of the heat equation
0u 02u
(1) (cid:2)c2

in the last section extends to bars of infinite length, which are good models of very long
bars or wires (such as a wire of length, say, 300 ft). Then the role of Fourier series in the
solution process will be taken by Fourier integrals (Sec. 11.7).
Let us illustrate the method by solving (1) for a bar that extends to infinity on both
sides (and is laterally insulated as before). Then we do not have boundary conditions, but
only the initial condition
(2) u(x, 0) (cid:2)f(x) ((cid:4)(cid:13) (cid:10)x(cid:10) (cid:13))
where f(x) is the given initial temperature of the bar.
To solve this problem, we start as in the last section, substituting u(x, t)(cid:2)F(x)G(t)
into (1). This gives the two ODEs
(3) Fs (cid:3)p2F(cid:2)0 [see (5), Sec. 12.6]
and
#
(4) G (cid:3)c2p2G(cid:2)0 [see (6), Sec. 12.6].
Solutions are
F(x)(cid:2)A cos px (cid:3)B sin px and G(t) (cid:2)e(cid:2)c2p2t,
respectively, where A and B are any constants. Hence a solution of (1) is
(5) u(x, t; p)(cid:2)FG(cid:2)(A cos px (cid:3)B sin px) e(cid:2)c2p2t.
Here we had to choose the separation constant k negative, k(cid:2)(cid:4)p2, because positive
values of kwould lead to an increasing exponential function in (5), which has no physical
meaning.
Use of Fourier Integrals
Any series of functions (5), found in the usual manner by taking pas multiples of a fixed
number, would lead to a function that is periodic in x when t(cid:2)0. However, since f(x)
c12-a.qxd 10/30/10 1:44 PM Page 569
SEC. 12.7 Heat Equation: Modeling Very Long Bars. Solution by Fourier Integrals and Transforms 569
in (2) is not assumed to be periodic, it is natural to use Fourier integralsinstead of Fourier
series. Also, Aand Bin (5) are arbitrary and we may regard them as functions of p, writing
A(cid:2)A(p) and B(cid:2)B(P). Now, since the heat equation (1) is linear and homogeneous,
the function
(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:2)(cid:4)

is then a solution of (1), provided this integral exists and can be differentiated twice with
respect to x and once with respect to t.
Determination of A(p) and B(p) from the Initial Condition. From (6) and (2) we get

(7) u(x, 0) (cid:2) [A(p) cos px (cid:3)B(p) sin px] dp(cid:2)f(x).

This gives A(p) and B(p) in terms of f(x); indeed, from (4) in Sec. 11.7 we have

Similarly, (6) in this section becomes

If f(x) is bounded for all values of x and integrable in every finite interval, it can be

function is the required solution in the present case.

Use of Fourier Transforms
The Fourier transform is closely related to the Fourier integral, from which we obtained the
transform in Sec. 11.9. And the transition to the Fourier cosine and sine transform in Sec.
11.8 was even simpler. (You may perhaps wish to review this before going on.) Hence it
should not surprise you that we can use these transforms for solving our present or similar
problems. The Fourier transform applies to problems concerning the entire axis, and the
Fourier cosine and sine transforms to problems involving the positive half-axis. Let us explain
these transform methods by typical applications that fit our present discussion.
EXAMPLE 2 Temperature in the Infinite Bar in Example 1
Solve Example 1 using the Fourier transform.
Solution. The problem consists of the heat equation (1) and the initial condition (2), which in this example is
f(x)(cid:2)U (cid:2)const if ƒxƒ (cid:10)1 and 0 otherwise.
0
Our strategy is to take the Fourier transform with respect to xand then to solve the resulting ordinaryDE in t.
The details are as follows.
Let uˆ (cid:2)f(u)denote the Fourier transform of u, regarded as a function of x. From (10) in Sec. 11.9 we see
that the heat equation (1) gives
f(u)(cid:2)c2f(u )(cid:2)c2((cid:4)w2)f(u)(cid:2)(cid:4)c2w2uˆ.
t xx
On the left, assuming that we may interchange the order of differentiation and integration, we have
1 (cid:2)(cid:4) 1 0 (cid:2)(cid:4) 0uˆ
f(u)(cid:2) ue(cid:2)iwx dx(cid:2) ue(cid:2)iwx dx(cid:2) .

(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:2)(cid:4)
Thus
0uˆ
(cid:2)(cid:4)c2w2uˆ.
0t
Since this equation involves only a derivative with respect to tbut none with respect to w, this is a first-order
ordinary DE, with tas the independent variable and was a parameter. By separating variables (Sec. 1.3) we
get the general solution
uˆ(w, t)(cid:2)C(w)e(cid:2)c2w2t
c12-a.qxd 10/30/10 1:44 PM Page 572
572 CHAP. 12 Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
with the arbitrary “constant” C(w)depending on the parameter w. The initial condition (2) yields the relationship
uˆ(w, 0)(cid:2)C(w)(cid:2) fˆ(w)(cid:2)f(f).Our intermediate result is
uˆ(w, t)(cid:2) fˆ(w)e(cid:2)c2w2t.
The inversion formula (7), Sec. 11.9, now gives the solution

Assuming that we may invert the order of integration, we then obtain

By the Euler formula (3). Sec. 11.9, the integrand of the inner integral equals
e(cid:2)c2w2t cos (wx(cid:4)wv)(cid:3)ie(cid:2)c2w2t sin (wx(cid:4)wv).
We see that its imaginary part is an odd function of w, so that its integral is 0. (More precisely, this is the
principal part of the integral; see Sec. 16.4.) The real part is an even function of w, so that its integral from (cid:4)(cid:13)
to (cid:13)equals twice the integral from 0 to (cid:13):
1

If a laterally insulated bar extends from x(cid:2)0to infinity, we can use the Fourier sine transform. We let the
initial temperature be u(x, 0)(cid:2)f(x)and impose the boundary condition u(0, t)(cid:2)0. Then from the heat equation

SEC. 12.8 Modeling: Membrane, Two-Dimensional Wave Equation 575
12.8
Modeling: Membrane,
Two-Dimensional Wave Equation
Since the modeling here will be similar to that of Sec. 12.2, you may want to take another
look at Sec. 12.2.
The vibrating string in Sec. 12.2 is a basic one-dimensional vibrational problem. Equally
important is its two-dimensional analog, namely, the motion of an elastic membrane, such
as a drumhead, that is stretched and then fixed along its edge. Indeed, setting up the model
will proceed almost as in Sec. 12.2.
Physical Assumptions
1. The mass of the membrane per unit area is constant (“homogeneous membrane”).
The membrane is perfectly flexible and offers no resistance to bending.
2. The membrane is stretched and then fixed along its entire boundary in the xy-plane.
The tension per unit length Tcaused by stretching the membrane is the same at all
points and in all directions and does not change during the motion.
3. The deflection u(x, y, t) of the membrane during the motion is small compared to
the size of the membrane, and all angles of inclination are small.
Although these assumptions cannot be realized exactly, they hold relatively accurately for
small transverse vibrations of a thin elastic membrane, so that we shall obtain a good
model, for instance, of a drumhead.
Derivation of the PDE of the Model (“Two-Dimensional Wave Equation”) fromForces.
As in Sec. 12.2 the model will consist of a PDE and additional conditions. The PDE will be
obtained by the same method as in Sec. 12.2, namely, by considering the forces acting on a
small portion of the physical system, the membrane in Fig. 301 on the next page, as it is
moving up and down.
Since the deflections of the membrane and the angles of inclination are small, the sides
of the portion are approximately equal to ¢x and ¢y. The tension T is the force per unit
length. Hence the forces acting on the sides of the portion are approximately T¢x and
T¢y. Since the membrane is perfectly flexible, these forces are tangent to the moving
membrane at every instant.
Horizontal Components of the Forces. We first consider the horizontal components
of the forces. These components are obtained by multiplying the forces by the cosines of
the angles of inclination. Since these angles are small, their cosines are close to 1. Hence
the horizontal components of the forces at opposite sides are approximately equal.
Therefore, the motion of the particles of the membrane in a horizontal direction will be
negligibly small. From this we conclude that we may regard the motion of the membrane
as transversal; that is, each particle moves vertically.
Vertical Components of the Forces. These components along the right side and the
left side are (Fig. 301), respectively,
T¢y sin b and (cid:2)T¢y sin a.
Here a and b are the values of the angle of inclination (which varies slightly along the
edges) in the middle of the edges, and the minus sign appears because the force on the

left side is directed downward. Since the angles are small, we may replace their sines by
their tangents. Hence the resultant of those two vertical components is

Newton’s Second Law Gives the PDE of the Model. By Newton’s second law (see
Sec. 2.4) the sum of the forces given by (1) and (2) is equal to the mass r¢A of that
small portion times the acceleration 02u 0t2; here r is the mass of the undeflected

membrane per unit area, and ¢A(cid:4) ¢x¢y is the area of that portion when it is unde-
flected. Thus

Rectangular note that the boundary in equation (2) is the rectangle in Fig. 302. We shall solve this
membrane problem in three steps:
c12-b.qxd 10/30/10 1:59 PM Page 578
578 CHAP. 12 Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
Step 1. By separating variables, first setting u(x, y, t)(cid:4)F(x, y)G(t) and later
F(x, y)(cid:4)H(x)Q(y)we obtain from (1) an ODE (4) for Gand later from a PDE (5) for F
two ODEs (6) and (7) for H and Q.
Step 2. From the solutions of those ODEs we determine solutions (13) of (1)
(“eigenfunctions” u ) that satisfy the boundary condition (2).
mn
Step 3. We compose the u into a double series (14) solving the whole model (1),
mn
(2), (3).
Step 1. Three ODEs From the Wave Equation (1)
To obtain ODEs from (1), we apply two successive separations of variables. In the first
separation we set u(x, y, t)(cid:4)F(x, y)G(t). Substitution into (1) gives
##
FG (cid:4)c2(F xxG(cid:3)F yyG)
where subscripts denote partial derivatives and dots denote derivatives with respect to t.
To separate the variables, we divide both sides by c2FG:
##
G
(cid:4)
1
(F (cid:3)F ).
c2G F xx yy
Since the left side depends only on t, whereas the right side is independent of t, both sides
must equal a constant. By a simple investigation we see that only negative values of that
constant will lead to solutions that satisfy (2) without being identically zero; this is similar
to Sec. 12.3. Denoting that negative constant by (cid:2)(cid:6)2, we have
##

SEC. 12.9 Rectangular Membrane. Double Fourier Series 579
Separation of the Helmholtz equation is achieved if we set F(x, y)(cid:4)H(x)Q(y). By
substitution of this into (5) we obtain
d2H d2Q
Q(cid:4)(cid:2) H (cid:3)(cid:6)2HQ .

To separate the variables, we divide both sides by HQ, finding
1 d2H 1 d2Q
(cid:4)(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:6)2Q .
H dx2 Q ady2 b
Both sides must equal a constant, by the usual argument. This constant must be negative,
say, (cid:2)k2,because only negative values will lead to solutions that satisfy (2) without being
identically zero. Thus
1 d2H 1 d2Q
(cid:4)(cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:6)2Q (cid:4)(cid:2)k2.

Step 2. Satisfying the Boundary Condition
General solutions of (6) and (7) are
H(x)(cid:4)A cos kx (cid:3)B sin kx and Q(y)(cid:4)C cos py (cid:3)D sin py
with constant A, B,C, D. From u(cid:4)FG and (2) it follows that F(cid:4)HQ must be zero on
the boundary, that is, on the edges x(cid:4)0, x(cid:4)a, y(cid:4)0, y(cid:4)b; see Fig. 302. This gives
the conditions
H(0) (cid:4)0, H(a)(cid:4)0, Q(0) (cid:4)0, Q(b)(cid:4)0.
Hence H(0) (cid:4)A(cid:4)0 and then H(a)(cid:4)B sin ka (cid:4)0. Here we must take B(cid:7)0 since
otherwise H(x)(cid:3)0 and F(x, y)(cid:3)0. Hence sin ka (cid:4)0 or ka(cid:4)mp, that is,

In precisely the same fashion we conclude that C(cid:4)0 and p must be restricted to the
values p(cid:4)np bwhere nis an integer. We thus obtain the solutions H(cid:4)H , Q(cid:4)Q ,

for a factor (cid:2)1. Hence the functions

Eigenfunctions and Eigenvalues. Having taken care of (5), we turn to (4). Since
p2(cid:4)(cid:6)2(cid:2)k2 in (7) and l(cid:4)cv in (4), we have
l(cid:4)c2k2(cid:3)p2.

Discussion of Eigenfunctions. It is very interesting that, depending on aand b, several
functions F may correspond to the same eigenvalue. Physically this means that there
mn
may exists vibrations having the same frequency but entirely different nodal lines (curves
of points on the membrane that do not move). Let us illustrate this with the following
example.

To discuss this solution, we note that the first term is very similar to the initial shape of the membrane, has no

Laplacian in Polar Coordinates.
Circular Membrane.
Fourier–Bessel Series
It is a general principlein boundary value problems for PDEs to choose coordinatesthat
make the formula for the boundary as simple as possible. Here polar coordinates are used
for this purpose as follows. Since we want to discuss circular membranes (drumheads),
we first transform the Laplacian in the wave equation (1), Sec. 12.9,
(1) u (cid:4)c2(cid:9)2u(cid:4)c2(u (cid:3)u )

By the chain rule (Sec. 9.6) we obtain
u (cid:4)u r (cid:3)u u .

Differentiating once more with respect to xand using the product rule and then again the
chain rule gives

Also, by differentiation of r and u we find

We substitute all these expressions into (2). Assuming continuity of the first and second

Circular Membrane
Circular membranes are important parts of drums, pumps, microphones, telephones, and
other devices. This accounts for their great importance in engineering. Whenever a circular
membrane is plane and its material is elastic, but offers no resistance to bending (this
excludes thin metallic membranes!), its vibrations are modeled by the two-dimensional
wave equation in polar coordinates obtained from (1) with (cid:9)2u given by (5), that is,

We shall consider a membrane of radius R (Fig. 307) and determine solutions u(r, t)

the problem set.) Then u (cid:4)0 in (6) and the model of the problem (the analog of (1),

Here (8) means that the membrane is fixed along the boundary circle r(cid:4)R. The initial
deflection f(r) and the initial velocity g(r) depend only on r, not on u, so that we can
expect radially symmetric solutions u(r, t).

Step 1. Two ODEs From the Wave Equation (7).
Bessel’s Equation
Using the method of separation of variables, we first determine solutions u(r, t)(cid:4)
W(r)G(t).(We write W, not Fbecause Wdepends on r, whereas F, used before, depended
on x.) Substituting u(cid:4)WG and its derivatives into (7) and dividing the result by c2WG,
we get
##
G (cid:4) 1 Ws (cid:3) 1 Wr
c2G W a r b
where dots denote derivatives with respect to tand primes denote derivatives with respect
to r. The expressions on both sides must equal a constant. This constant must be negative,
say, (cid:2)k2, in order to obtain solutions that satisfy the boundary condition without being
identically zero. Thus,
##
G (cid:4) 1 Ws (cid:3) 1 Wr (cid:4)(cid:2)k2.
c2G W a r b
This gives the two linear ODEs

(10) G (cid:3)l2G(cid:4)0 where l(cid:4)ck

(11) Ws (cid:3) 1 Wr (cid:3)k2W(cid:4)0.
r
We can reduce (11) to Bessel’s equation (Sec. 5.4) if we set s(cid:4)kr.Then 1 r(cid:4)k sand,
> >
retaining the notation W for simplicity, we obtain by the chain rule
Wr (cid:4) dW (cid:4) dW ds (cid:4) dW k and Ws (cid:4) d2W k2.
dr ds dr ds ds2
By substituting this into (11) and omitting the common factor k2 we have
d2W 1 dW
(12) (cid:3) (cid:3)W(cid:4)0.
ds2 s ds
This is Bessel’s equation (1), Sec. 5.4, with parameter (cid:6)(cid:4)0.
Step 2. Satisfying the Boundary Condition (8)
Solutions of (12) are the Bessel functions J and Y of the first and second kind (see Secs.
0 0
5.4, 5.5). But Y becomes infinite at 0, so that we cannot use it because the deflection of
0
the membrane must always remain finite. This leaves us with
(13) W(r)(cid:4)J (s)(cid:4)J (kr) (s (cid:4)kr).
0 0
c12-b.qxd 10/30/10 1:59 PM Page 588
588 CHAP. 12 Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
On the boundary r(cid:4)Rwe get W(R)(cid:4)J (kR)(cid:4)0from (8) (because G(cid:3)0would imply
0
u(cid:3)0). We can satisfy this condition because J has (infinitely many) positive zeros,

m
The vibration of the membrane corresponding to u is called the mth normal mode;
m
it has the frequency l 2p cycles per unit time. Since the zeros of the Bessel function
m>
J are not regularly spaced on the axis (in contrast to the zeros of the sine functions
0
appearing in the case of the vibrating string), the sound of a drum is entirely different
from that of a violin. The forms of the normal modes can easily be obtained from Fig.308
and are shown in Fig. 309. For m(cid:4)1,all the points of the membrane move up (or down)
at the same time. For m(cid:4)2,the situation is as follows. The function W (r)(cid:4)J (a r R)

is zero for a r R(cid:4)a ,thus r(cid:4)a R a .The circle r(cid:4)a R a is, therefore, nodal line,

and when at some instant the central part of the membrane moves up, the outer part
(r(cid:10)a R a )moves down, and conversely. The solution u (r, t)has m(cid:2)1nodal lines,
1 > 2 m
which are circles (Fig. 309).

Step 3. Solution of the Entire Problem
To obtain a solution u(r, t) that also satisfies the initial conditions (9), we may proceed
as in the case of the string. That is, we consider the series
(cid:3) (cid:3) a
(17) u (r, t)(cid:4) a W m(r)G m(t)(cid:4) a (A m cos l mt(cid:3)B m sin l mt)J 0 a Rm r b
m(cid:4)1 m(cid:4)1
(leaving aside the problems of convergence and uniqueness). Setting t(cid:4)0and using (9a),
we obtain
(cid:3) a
(18) u (r, 0) (cid:4) a A mJ 0 a Rm r b(cid:4)f (r).
m(cid:4)1
Thus for the series (17) to satisfy the condition (9a), the constants A must be the
m
coefficients of the Fourier–Bessel series (18) that represents f(r)in terms of J (a r R);

that is [see (9) in Sec. 11.6 with n(cid:4)0, a (cid:4)a , and x(cid:4)r],

Differentiability of f(r) in the interval 0(cid:11)r(cid:11)R is sufficient for the existence of the
development (18); see Ref. [A13]. The coefficients B in (17) can be determined from
m
(9b) in a similar fashion. Numeric values of A and B may be obtained from a CAS or
m m
by a numeric integration method, using tables of J and J .However, numeric integration

Laplace’s Equation in Cylindrical and
Spherical Coordinates. Potential
One of the most important PDEs in physics and engineering applications is Laplace’s
equation, given by
(1) (cid:9)2u(cid:4)u (cid:3)u (cid:3)u (cid:4)0.
xx yy zz
Here, x, y, zare Cartesian coordinates in space (Fig. 167 in Sec. 9.1), u (cid:4) 02u 0x2,etc.
xx >
The expression (cid:9)2u is called the Laplacian of u. The theory of the solutions of (1) is
called potential theory. Solutions of (1) that have continuous second partial derivatives
are known as harmonic functions.
Laplace’s equation occurs mainly in gravitation,electrostatics(see Theorem 3, Sec. 9.7),
steady-state heat flow(Sec. 12.5), and fluid flow(to be discussed in Sec. 18.4).
Recall from Sec. 9.7 that the gravitational potentialu(x, y, z) at a point (x, y, z) resulting
from a single mass located at a point (X, Y, Z) is

and u satisfies (1). Similarly, if mass is distributed in a region T in space with density
r(X, Y, Z), its potential at a point (x, y, z) not occupied by mass is

It satisfies (1) because (cid:9)2(1 r) (cid:4)0 (Sec. 9.7) and r is not a function of x, y, z.

Practical problems involving Laplace’s equation are boundary value problems in a
region Tin space with boundary surface S. Such problems can be grouped into three types
(see also Sec. 12.6 for the two-dimensional case):
(I) First boundary value problem or Dirichlet problem if u is prescribed on S.
(II) Second boundary value problem or Neumann problem if the normal
derivative u (cid:4) 0u 0n is prescribed on S.
n >
(III) Thirdor mixed boundary value problemor Robin problemif uis prescribed
on a portion of S and u on the remaining portion of S.
n
In general, when we want to solve a boundary value problem, we have to first select
the appropriate coordinates in which the boundary surface S has a simple representation.
Here are some examples followed by some applications.
Laplacian in Cylindrical Coordinates
The first step in solving a boundary value problem is generally the introduction of
coordinates in which the boundary surface S has a simple representation. Cylindrical
symmetry (a cylinder as a region T) calls for cylindrical coordinates r, u, z related to
x, y, z by
(4) x(cid:4)r cos u, y(cid:4)r sin u, z(cid:4)z (Fig. 311).

Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates
Spherical symmetry (a ball as region T bounded by a sphere S) requires spherical
coordinates r, u, (cid:3) related to x, y, z by
(6) x(cid:4)rcos u sin (cid:3), y(cid:4)r sin u sin (cid:3), z(cid:4)r cos (cid:3) (Fig. 312).
Using the chain rule (as in Sec. 12.10), we obtain (cid:9)2u in spherical coordinates

for polar coordinates. Unfortunately, some books use uand (cid:3)interchanged, an extension
of the notation x(cid:4)r cos (cid:3), y (cid:4)r sin (cid:3) for polar coordinates (used in some European
countries).

The PDE (8) follows from (7) or (7 )by assuming that the solution uwill not depend on
u because the Dirichlet condition (9) is independent of u. This may be an electrostatic
potential (or a temperature) f((cid:3)) at which the sphere S: r(cid:4)R is kept. Condition (10)
means that the potential at infinity will be zero.
Separating Variables by substituting u(r, (cid:3))(cid:4)G(r)H((cid:3))into (8). Multiplying (8) by
r2, making the substitution and then dividing by GH, we obtain
1 d dG 1 d dH
r2 (cid:4)(cid:2) sin (cid:3) .
G dr a dr b H sin (cid:3) d (cid:3) a d(cid:3) b
By the usual argument both sides must be equal to a constant k. Thus we get the two
ODEs

(11) r2 (cid:4)k or r2 (cid:3)2r (cid:4)kG

and
1 d dH
(12) sin (cid:3) (cid:3)kH(cid:4)0.
sin (cid:3) d(cid:3)a d(cid:3) b
The solutions of (11) will take a simple form if we set k(cid:4)n(n(cid:3)1). Then, writing
Gr (cid:4)dG dr, etc., we obtain
>
(13) r2Gs (cid:3)2rGr (cid:2)n(n(cid:3)1) G (cid:4)0.
This is an Euler–Cauchy equation. From Sec. 2.5 we know that it has solutions G(cid:4)ra.
Substituting this and dropping the common factor ra gives
a(a(cid:2)1)(cid:3)2a(cid:2)n(n(cid:3)1)(cid:4)0. The roots are a(cid:4)n and (cid:2)n(cid:2)1.
Hence solutions are

If f((cid:3)) and fr ((cid:3)) are piecewise continuous on the interval 0(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:11)p, then the series
(17) with coefficients (19) solves our problem for points inside the sphere because it can
be shown that under these continuity assumptions the series (17) with coefficients (19)
gives the derivatives occurring in (8) by termwise differentiation, thus justifying our
derivation.

The next example illustrates all this for a sphere of radius 1 consisting of two hemispheres
that are separated by a small strip of insulating material along the equator, so that these
hemispheres can be kept at different potentials (110 V and 0 V).
EXAMPLE 1 Spherical Capacitor
Find the potential inside and outside a spherical capacitor consisting of two metallic hemispheres of radius 1 ft
separated by a small slit for reasons of insulation, if the upper hemisphere is kept at 110 V and the lower is
grounded (Fig. 313).

Solution of PDEs by Laplace Transforms
Readers familiar with Chap. 6 may wonder whether Laplace transforms can also be used
for solving partial differential equations. The answer is yes, particularly if one of the
independent variables ranges over the positive axis. The steps to obtain a solution are
similar to those in Chap. 6. For a PDE in two variables they are as follows.
1. Take the Laplace transform with respect to one of the two variables, usually t. This
gives an ODE for the transform of the unknown function. This is so since the
derivatives of this function with respect to the other variable slip into the
transformed equation. The latter also incorporates the given boundary and initial
conditions.
2. Solving that ODE, obtain the transform of the unknown function.
3. Taking the inverse transform, obtain the solution of the given problem.
If the coefficients of the given equation do not depend on t, the use of Laplace transforms
will simplify the problem.
We explain the method in terms of a typical example.
EXAMPLE 1 Semi-Infinite String
Find the displacement w(x, t)of an elastic string subject to the following conditions. (We write wsince we need
uto denote the unit step function.)
(i) The string is initially at rest on the x-axis from x(cid:4)0to (cid:13)(“semi-infinite string”).
(ii) For t(cid:10)0the left end of the string (x(cid:4)0)is moved in a given fashion, namely, according to a single

Since this equation contains only a derivative with respect to x, it may be regarded as an ordinary differential

(4) W (x, s)(cid:4)A (s)esx >c(cid:3)B (s)e(cid:4)sx >c.
From (2) we obtain, writing F(s)(cid:4)l{f(t)},
W(0, s)(cid:4)l{w(0, t)}(cid:4)l{f(t)}(cid:4)F(s).
Assuming that we can interchange integration and taking the limit, we have
(cid:4)(cid:3) (cid:4)(cid:3)
lim W(x, s)(cid:4) lim e(cid:4)stw(x, t) dt(cid:4) e(cid:4)st lim w(x, t) dt(cid:4)0.

This implies A (s)(cid:4)0in (4) because c(cid:10)0, so that for every fixed positive sthe function esx >cincreases as x
increases. Note that we may assume s(cid:10)0since a Laplace transform generally exists for all sgreater than some
fixed k(Sec. 6.2). Hence we have
W(0, s)(cid:4)B(s)(cid:4)F(s),
so that (4) becomes
W (x, s)(cid:4)F (s)e(cid:4)sx >c.

We have reached the end of Chapter 12, in which we concentrated on the most important
partial differential equations (PDEs) in physics and engineering. We have also reached
the end of Part C on Fourier Analysis and PDEs.
Outlook
We have seen that PDEs underlie the modeling process of various important engineering
application. Indeed, PDEs are the subject of many ongoing research projects.
Numerics for PDEsfollows in Secs. 21.4–21.7, which, by design for greater flexibility
in teaching, are independent of the other sections in Part E on numerics.
In the next part, that is, Part D on complex analysis, we turn to an area of a different
nature that is also highly important to the engineer. The rich vein of examples and problems
will signify this. It is of note that Part D includes another approach to the two-dimensional
Laplace equation with applications, as shown in Chap. 18.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
Whereas ODEs (Chaps. 1–6) serve as models of problems involving only one
independent variable, problems involving two or more independent variables (space
variables or time tand one or several space variables) lead to PDEs. This accounts for
the enormous importance of PDEs to the engineer and physicist. Most important are:
(1) u (cid:4)c2u One-dimensional wave equation (Secs. 12.2–12.4)

Summary of Chapter 12 605
In practice, one is interested in obtaining the solution of such an equation in a
given region satisfying given additional conditions, such as initial conditions
(conditions at time t(cid:4)0) or boundary conditions(prescribed values of the solution
uor some of its derivatives on the boundary surface S, or boundary curve C, of the
region) or both. For (1) and (2) one prescribes two initial conditions (initial
displacement and initial velocity). For (3) one prescribes the initial temperature
distribution. For (4) and (5) one prescribes a boundary condition and calls the
resulting problem a (see Sec. 12.6)
Dirichlet problem if u is prescribed on S,
Neumann problem if u (cid:4) 0u 0n is prescribed on S,
n >
Mixed problem if u is prescribed on one part of S and u on the other.
n
A general method for solving such problems is the method of separating
variables or product method, in which one assumes solutions in the form of
products of functions each depending on one variable only. Thus equation (1) is
solved by setting u(x, t)(cid:4)F(x)G(t); see Sec. 12.3; similarly for (3) (see Sec. 12.6).
Substitution into the given equation yields ordinarydifferential equations for Fand
G, and from these one gets infinitely many solutions F(cid:4)F and G(cid:4)G such that
n n
the corresponding functions
u (x, t)(cid:4)F (x)G (t)
n n n
are solutions of the PDE satisfying the given boundary conditions. These are the
eigenfunctions of the problem, and the corresponding eigenvalues determine the
frequency of the vibration (or the rapidity of the decrease of temperature in the case
of the heat equation, etc.). To satisfy also the initial condition (or conditions), one
must consider infinite series of the u , whose coefficients turn out to be the Fourier
n
coefficients of the functions f and g representing the given initial conditions (Secs.
12.3, 12.6). Hence Fourier series (and Fourier integrals) are of basic importance
here (Secs. 12.3, 12.6, 12.7, 12.9).
Steady-state problems are problems in which the solution does not depend on
time t. For these, the heat equation u (cid:4)c2(cid:9)2u becomes the Laplace equation.
t
Before solving an initial or boundary value problem, one often transforms the
PDE into coordinates in which the boundary of the region considered is given by
simple formulas. Thus in polar coordinates given by x(cid:4)r cos u, y (cid:4)r sin u, the
Laplacian becomes (Sec. 12.11)

for spherical coordinates see Sec. 12.10. If one now separates the variables, one gets
Bessel’s equation from (2) and (6) (vibrating circular membrane, Sec. 12.10) and
Legendre’s equation from (5) transformed into spherical coordinates (Sec. 12.11).

Complex analysis has many applications in heat conduction, fluid flow, electrostatics, and
in other areas. It extends the familiar “real calculus” to “complex calculus” by introducing
complex numbers and functions. While many ideas carry over from calculus to complex
analysis, there is a marked difference between the two. For example, analytic functions,
which are the “good functions” (differentiable in some domain) of complex analysis, have
derivatives of all orders. This is in contrast to calculus, where real-valued functions of
real variables may have derivatives only up to a certain order. Thus, in certain ways,
problems that are difficult to solve in real calculus may be much easier to solve in complex
analysis. Complex analysis is important in applied mathematics for three main reasons:
1. Two-dimensional potential problems can be modeled and solved by methods of
analytic functions. This reason is the real and imaginary parts of analytic functions satisfy
Laplace’s equation in two real variables.
2. Many difficult integrals (real or complex) that appear in applications can be solved
quite elegantly by complex integration.
3. Most functions in engineering mathematics are analytic functions, and their study
as functions of a complex variable leads to a deeper understanding of their properties and
to interrelations in complex that have no analog in real calculus.

The transition from “real calculus” to “complex calculus” starts with a discussion of
complex numbers and their geometric representation in the complex plane. We then
progress to analytic functions in Sec. 13.3. We desire functions to be analytic because
these are the “useful functions” in the sense that they are differentiable in some domain
and operations of complex analysis can be applied to them. The most important equations
are therefore the Cauchy–Riemann equations in Sec. 13.4 because they allow a test of
analyticity of such functions. Moreover, we show how the Cauchy–Riemann equations
are related to the important Laplace equation.
The remaining sections of the chapter are devoted to elementary complex functions
(exponential, trigonometric, hyperbolic, and logarithmic functions). These generalize the
familiar real functions of calculus. Detailed knowledge of them is an absolute necessity
in practical work, just as that of their real counterparts is in calculus.

Complex Numbers and
Their Geometric Representation
The material in this section will most likely be familiar to the student and serve as a
review.
Equations without real solutions, such as x2(cid:2)(cid:3)1 or x2(cid:3)10x(cid:4)40(cid:2)0, were
observed early in history and led to the introduction of complex numbers.1 By definition,
a complex number z is an ordered pair (x, y) of real numbers x and y, written
z(cid:2)(x, y).
1First to use complex numbers for this purpose was the Italian mathematician GIROLAMO CARDANO
(1501–1576), who found the formula for solving cubic equations. The term “complex number” was introduced
by CARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS (see the footnote in Sec. 5.4), who also paved the way for a general use of
complex numbers.

c13.qxd 10/30/10 2:14 PM Page 609
SEC. 13.1 Complex Numbers and Their Geometric Representation 609
x is called the real part and y the imaginary part of z, written
x(cid:2)Re z, y(cid:2)Im z.
By definition, two complex numbers are equal if and only if their real parts are equal
and their imaginary parts are equal.
(0, 1) is called the imaginary unit and is denoted by i,
(1) i(cid:2)(0, 1).
(cid:2) (cid:4)
Addition, Multiplication. Notation z x iy
Addition of two complex numbers z (cid:2)(x , y ) and z (cid:2)(x , y ) is defined by
1 1 1 2 2 2
(2) z (cid:4)z (cid:2)(x , y )(cid:4)(x , y )(cid:2)(x (cid:4)x , y (cid:4)y ).
1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2
Multiplication is defined by
(3) z z (cid:2)(x , y )(x , y )(cid:2)(x x (cid:3)y y , x y (cid:4)x y ).
1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1
These two definitions imply that
(x , 0)(cid:4)(x , 0)(cid:2)(x (cid:4)x , 0)
1 2 1 2
and
(x , 0)(x , 0)(cid:2)(x x , 0)
1 2 1 2
as for real numbers x , x . Hence the complex numbers “extend” the real numbers. We
1 2
can thus write
(x, 0) (cid:2)x. Similarly, (0, y) (cid:2)iy
because by (1), and the definition of multiplication, we have
# # # #
iy(cid:2)(0, 1)y (cid:2)(0, 1)(y, 0)(cid:2)(0 y(cid:3)1 0, 0 0(cid:4)1 y)(cid:2)(0, y).
Together we have, by addition, (x, y) (cid:2)(x, 0) (cid:4)(0, y) (cid:2)x(cid:4)iy.
In practice, complex numbers z(cid:2)(x, y) are written
(4) z(cid:2)x(cid:4)iy
or z(cid:2)x(cid:4)yi, e.g., 17(cid:4)4i (instead of i4).
Electrical engineers often write j instead of i because they need i for the current.
If x(cid:2)0, then z(cid:2)iy and is called pure imaginary. Also, (1) and (3) give
(5) i2(cid:2)(cid:3)1
because, by the definition of multiplication, i2(cid:2)ii (cid:2)(0, 1)(0, 1)(cid:2)((cid:3)1, 0)(cid:2)(cid:3)1.

For addition the standard notation (4) gives [see (2)]
(x (cid:4)iy )(cid:4)(x (cid:4)iy )(cid:2)(x (cid:4)x )(cid:4)i(y (cid:4)y ).
1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2
For multiplicationthe standard notation gives the following very simple recipe. Multiply
each term by each other term and use i2(cid:2)(cid:3)1 when it occurs [see (3)]:
(x (cid:4)iy )(x (cid:4)iy )(cid:2)x x (cid:4)ix y (cid:4)iy x (cid:4)i2y y
1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
(cid:2)(x x (cid:3)y y )(cid:4)i(x y (cid:4)x y ).
1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1
This agrees with (3). And it shows that x(cid:4)iy is a more practical notation for complex
numbers than (x, y).
If you know vectors, you see that (2) is vector addition, whereas the multiplication (3)
has no counterpart in the usual vector algebra.

we obtain x (cid:2)x x(cid:3)y y, y (cid:2)y x(cid:4)x y. The solution is

SEC. 13.1 Complex Numbers and Their Geometric Representation 611
Complex numbers satisfy the same commutative, associative, and distributive laws as real
numbers (see the problem set).
Complex Plane
So far we discussed the algebraic manipulation of complex numbers. Consider the
geometric representation of complex numbers, which is of great practical importance. We
choose two perpendicular coordinate axes, the horizontal x-axis, called the real axis, and
the vertical y-axis, called the imaginary axis. On both axes we choose the same unit of
length (Fig. 318). This is called a Cartesian coordinate system.

We now plot a given complex number z(cid:2)(x, y) (cid:2)x(cid:4)iyas the point Pwith coordinates
x, y. The xy-plane in which the complex numbers are represented in this way is called the
complex plane.2 Figure 319 shows an example.
Instead of saying “the point represented by zin the complex plane” we say briefly and
simply “the point z in the complex plane.” This will cause no misunderstanding.
Addition and subtraction can now be visualized as illustrated in Figs. 320 and 321.

Complex Conjugate Numbers
The complex conjugate z of a complex number z(cid:2)x(cid:4)iy is defined by
z (cid:2)x(cid:3)iy.
It is obtained geometrically by reflecting the point z in the real axis. Figure 322 shows
this for z(cid:2)5(cid:4)2i and its conjugate z (cid:2)5(cid:3)2i.

The complex conjugate is important because it permits us to switch from complex
to real. Indeed, by multiplication, zz(cid:2)x2(cid:4)y2 (verify!). By addition and subtraction,
z(cid:4)z(cid:2)2x, z(cid:3)z(cid:2)2iy. We thus obtain for the real part x and the imaginary part y

Polar Form of Complex Numbers.
Powers and Roots
We gain further insight into the arithmetic operations of complex numbers if, in addition
to the xy-coordinates in the complex plane, we also employ the usual polar coordinates
r, u defined by
(1) x(cid:2)r cos u, y(cid:2)r sin u.
We see that then z(cid:2)x(cid:4)iy takes the so-called polar form
(2) z(cid:2)r(cos u(cid:4)i sin u).
r is called the absolute value or modulus of z and is denoted by ƒzƒ. Hence
(3) ƒzƒ (cid:2)r(cid:2) 2x2(cid:4)y2(cid:2) 1zz.
Geometrically, ƒzƒ is the distance of the point z from the origin (Fig. 323). Similarly,
ƒz (cid:3)z ƒ is the distance between z and z (Fig. 324).
1 2 1 2
u is called the argument of z and is denoted by arg z. Thus u(cid:2)arg z and (Fig. 323)
y
(4) tan u (cid:2) (z(cid:5)0).
x
Geometrically, u is the directed angle from the positive x-axis to OPin Fig. 323. Here, as
in calculus, all angles are measured in radians and positive in the counterclockwise sense.

614 CHAP. 13 Complex Numbers and Functions. Complex Differentiation
For z(cid:2)0this angle uis undefined. (Why?) For a given z(cid:5)0it is determined only up
to integer multiples of 2p since cosine and sine are periodic with period 2p. But one
often wants to specify a unique value of arg zof a given z(cid:5)0. For this reason one defines
the principal value Arg z (with capital A!) of arg z by the double inequality
(5) (cid:3)p(cid:7)Arg z (cid:8)p.
Then we have Arg z(cid:2)0 for positive real z(cid:2)x, which is practical, and Arg z(cid:2)p (not
(cid:3)p!) for negative real z, e.g., for z(cid:2)(cid:3)4. The principal value (5) will be important in
connection with roots, the complex logarithm (Sec. 13.7), and certain integrals. Obviously,
for a given z(cid:5)0,the other values of arg z arearg z(cid:2)Arg z (cid:6) 2np (n(cid:2)(cid:6)1, (cid:6)2,Á ).

Triangle Inequality
Inequalities such as x (cid:7)x make sense for realnumbers, but not in complex because there
1 2
is no natural way of ordering complex numbers. However, inequalities between absolute values
(which are real!), such as ƒz ƒ (cid:7) ƒz ƒ (meaning that z is closer to the origin than z ) are of

Multiplication and Division in Polar Form

De Moivre’s formula3
(13*) (cos u(cid:4)i sin u)n(cid:2)cos nu(cid:4)i sin nu.
We can use this to express cos nuand sin nuin terms of powers of cos uand sin u. For instance, for n(cid:2)2we
have on the left cos2 u(cid:4)2i cos u sin u(cid:3)sin2 u.Taking the real and imaginary parts on both sides of (13*)
with n(cid:2)2gives the familiar formulas
cos 2u(cid:2)cos2 u(cid:3)sin2 u, sin 2u(cid:2)2 cos u sin u.
This shows that complexmethods often simplify the derivation of realformulas. Try n(cid:2)3. (cid:2)
Roots
If z(cid:2)wn (n(cid:2)1, 2,Á ), then to each value of w there corresponds one value of z. We
shall immediately see that, conversely, to a given z(cid:5)0 there correspond precisely n
distinct values of w. Each of these values is called an nth root of z, and we write

in trigonometry and also contributed to probability theory (see Sec. 24.8).

(14) w(cid:2) 1n z.
Hence this symbol is multivalued, namely, n-valued.The nvalues of
1n
zcan be obtained
as follows. We write z and w in polar form
z(cid:2)r(cos u (cid:4)i sin u) and w(cid:2)R(cos (cid:2) (cid:4)i sin (cid:2)).
Then the equation wn (cid:2)z becomes, by De Moivre’s formula (with (cid:2) instead of u),
wn (cid:2)Rn(cos n(cid:2) (cid:4)i sin n(cid:2)) (cid:2)z(cid:2)r(cos u (cid:4)i sin u).
The absolute values on both sides must be equal; thus, Rn(cid:2)r, so that R(cid:2) 1n r, where
1n
ris positive real (an absolute value must be nonnegative!) and thus uniquely determined.
Equating the arguments n(cid:2) and u and recalling that u is determined only up to integer
multiples of 2p, we obtain

of k would give values already obtained. For instance, k(cid:2)n gives 2kp n(cid:2)2p, hence
the wcorresponding to k(cid:2)0, etc. Consequently, 1n z,for z(cid:5)0, has the > ndistinct values

by taking the principal value of arg z and k(cid:2)0 in (15) is called the principal value of

Derivative. Analytic Function
Just as the study of calculus or real analysis required concepts such as domain,
neighborhood, function, limit, continuity, derivative, etc., so does the study of complex
analysis. Since the functions live in the complex plane, the concepts are slightly more
difficult or different from those in real analysis. This section can be seen as a reference
section where many of the concepts needed for the rest of Part D are introduced.

because it is the set of all zwhose distance ƒz(cid:3)aƒ from the center aequals r.Accordingly,
its interior (“open circular disk”) is given by ƒz(cid:3)aƒ (cid:7)r, its interior plus the circle
itself (“closed circular disk”) by ƒz(cid:3)aƒ (cid:8)r, and its exterior by ƒz(cid:3)aƒ (cid:10)r. As an
example, sketch this for a(cid:2)1(cid:4)i and r(cid:2)2, to make sure that you understand these
inequalities.
An open circular disk ƒz(cid:3)aƒ (cid:7)ris also called a neighborhoodof aor, more precisely,
a r-neighborhoodof a. And ahas infinitely many of them, one for each value of r ((cid:10)0),
and a is a point of each of them, by definition!
In modern literature any set containing a r-neighborhood of a is also called a neigh-
borhood of a.
Figure 332 shows an open annulus(circular ring) r (cid:7) ƒz(cid:3)aƒ (cid:7)r ,which we shall
1 2
need later. This is the set of all z whose distance ƒz(cid:3)aƒ from a is greater than r but

less than r . Similarly, the closed annulus r (cid:8) ƒz(cid:3)aƒ (cid:8)r includes the two circles.

Half-Planes. By the (open) upper half-plane we mean the set of all points z(cid:2)x(cid:4)iy

right half-plane, and x(cid:7)0 the left half-plane.

620 CHAP. 13 Complex Numbers and Functions. Complex Differentiation
For Reference: Concepts on Sets
in the Complex Plane
To our discussion of special sets let us add some general concepts related to sets that we
shall need throughout Chaps. 13–18; keep in mind that you can find them here.
By a point setin the complex plane we mean any sort of collection of finitely many
or infinitely many points. Examples are the solutions of a quadratic equation, the
points of a line, the points in the interior of a circle as well as the sets discussed just
before.
A set S is called open if every point of S has a neighborhood consisting entirely of
points that belong to S. For example, the points in the interior of a circle or a square form
an open set, and so do the points of the right half-plane Re z(cid:2)x(cid:10)0.
A set Sis called connectedif any two of its points can be joined by a chain of finitely
many straight-line segments all of whose points belong to S. An open and connected set
is called a domain.Thus an open disk and an open annulus are domains. An open square
with a diagonal removed is not a domain since this set is not connected. (Why?)
The complement of a set Sin the complex plane is the set of all points of the complex
plane that do not belongto S. A set Sis called closedif its complement is open. For example,
the points on and inside the unit circle form a closed set (“closed unit disk”) since its
complement |zƒ (cid:10)1is open.
A boundary pointof a set Sis a point every neighborhood of which contains both points
that belong to S and points that do not belong to S. For example, the boundary points of
an annulus are the points on the two bounding circles. Clearly, if a set S is open, then no
boundary point belongs to S; if S is closed, then every boundary point belongs to S. The
set of all boundary points of a set S is called the boundary of S.
A regionis a set consisting of a domain plus, perhaps, some or all of its boundary points.
WARNING!“Domain” is the modernterm for an open connected set. Nevertheless, some
authors still call a domain a “region” and others make no distinction between the two terms.
Complex Function
Complex analysis is concerned with complex functions that are differentiable in some
domain. Hence we should first say what we mean by a complex function and then define
the concepts of limit and derivative in complex. This discussion will be similar to that in
calculus. Nevertheless it needs great attention because it will show interesting basic
differences between real and complex calculus.
Recall from calculus that a realfunction fdefined on a set Sof real numbers (usually an
interval) is a rule that assigns to every xin S a real number f(x), called the valueof f at x.
Now in complex, S is a set of complex numbers. And a function f defined on S is a rule
that assigns to every zin Sa complex number w, called the valueof fat z. We write
w(cid:2)f(z).
Here z varies in S and is called a complex variable. The set S is called the domain of
definition of f or, briefly, the domain of f. (In most cases S will be open and connected,
thus a domain as defined just before.)
Example: w(cid:2)f(z)(cid:2)z2(cid:4)3zis a complex function defined for all z; that is, its domain
S is the whole complex plane.
The set of all values of a function f is called the range of f.
c13.qxd 10/30/10 2:14 PM Page 621
SEC. 13.3 Derivative. Analytic Function 621
w is complex, and we write w(cid:2)u(cid:4)iv, where u and v are the real and imaginary
parts, respectively. Now wdepends on z(cid:2)x(cid:4)iy.Hence ubecomes a real function of x
and y, and so does v. We may thus write
w(cid:2)f(z)(cid:2)u(x, y) (cid:4)iv(x, y).
This shows that a complex function f(z) is equivalent to a pair of real functions u(x, y)
and v(x, y), each depending on the two real variables x and y.
EXAMPLE 1 Function of a Complex Variable
Let w(cid:2)f(z)(cid:2)z2(cid:4)3z.Find uand vand calculate the value of fat z(cid:2)1(cid:4)3i.

This shows that u(1, 3)(cid:2)(cid:3)5and v(1, 3)(cid:2)15.Check this by using the expressions for uand v. (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 2 Function of a Complex Variable

Solution. f(z)(cid:2)2i(x(cid:4)iy)(cid:4)6(x(cid:3)iy)gives u(x, y)(cid:2)6x(cid:3)2yand v(x, y)(cid:2)2x(cid:3)6y.Also,

Check this as in Example 1.
Remarks on Notation and Terminology
1. Strictly speaking, f(z) denotes the value of f at z, but it is a convenient abuse of
language to talk about the functionf(z) (instead of the functionf), thereby exhibiting the
notation for the independent variable.
2. We assume all functions to be single-valued relations, as usual: to each zin Sthere
corresponds but one value w(cid:2)f(z) (but, of course, several z may give the same value
w(cid:2)f(z), just as in calculus). Accordingly, we shall not use the term “multivalued
function” (used in some books on complex analysis) for a multivalued relation, in which
to a z there corresponds more than one w.
Limit, Continuity
A function f(z) is said to have the limit l as z approaches a point z , written
0
(1) lim f(z)(cid:2)l,
z:z
0
if f is defined in a neighborhood of z (except perhaps at z itself) and if the values of
0 0
fare “close” to lfor all z“close” to z ;in precise terms, if for every positive real Pwe can
0
find a positive real dsuch that for all z(cid:5)z in the disk ƒz(cid:3)z ƒ (cid:7)d(Fig. 333) we have
0 0
(2) ƒf(z)(cid:3)lƒ (cid:7)P;
geometrically, if for every z(cid:5)z in that d-disk the value of f lies in the disk (2).

Formally, this definition is similar to that in calculus, but there is a big difference.

important and should be kept in mind.

It may come as a surprise that there are many complex functions that do not have a derivative at any point. For

Surprising as Example 4 may be, it merely illustrates that differentiability of a complex

The idea of proof (approach of z from different directions) is basic and will be used
again as the crucial argument in the next section.
Analytic Functions
Complex analysis is concerned with the theory and application of “analytic functions,”
that is, functions that are differentiable in some domain, so that we can do “calculus in
complex.” The definition is as follows.
DEFINITION Analyticity
A function f(z)is said to be analytic in a domain Dif f(z) is defined and differentiable
at all points of D. The function f(z) is said to be analytic at a point z(cid:2)z in D if
0
f(z) is analytic in a neighborhood of z .
0
Also, by an analytic functionwe mean a function that is analytic in somedomain.
Hence analyticity of f(z) at z means that f(z) has a derivative at every point in some
0
neighborhood of z (including z itself since, by definition, z is a point of all its
0 0 0
neighborhoods). This concept is motivated by the fact that it is of no practical interest
if a function is differentiable merely at a single point z but not throughout some
0
neighborhood of z . Team Project 24 gives an example.
0
A more modern term for analytic in D is holomorphic in D.

The concepts discussed in this section extend familiar concepts of calculus. Most
important is the concept of an analytic function, the exclusive concern of complex
analysis. Although many simple functions are not analytic, the large variety of remaining
functions will yield a most beautiful branch of mathematics that is very useful in
engineering and physics.

Cauchy–Riemann Equations.
Laplace’s Equation
As we saw in the last section, to do complex analysis (i.e., “calculus in the complex”) on
any complex function, we require that function to be analytic on some domain that is
differentiable in that domain.
The Cauchy–Riemann equations are the most important equations in this chapter
and one of the pillars on which complex analysis rests. They provide a criterion (a test)
for the analyticity of a complex function
w(cid:2)f(z)(cid:2)u(x, y) (cid:4)iv(x, y).
Roughly, f is analytic in a domain D if and only if the first partial derivatives of u and v
satisfy the two Cauchy–Riemann equations4
(1) u (cid:2)v , u (cid:2)(cid:3)v
x y y x
everywhere in D; here u (cid:2) 0u 0x and u (cid:2) 0u 0y (and similarly for v) are the usual
x > y >
notations for partial derivatives. The precise formulation of this statement is given in
Theorems 1 and 2.
Example: f(z)(cid:2)z2(cid:2)x2(cid:3)y2(cid:4)2ixyis analytic for all z(see Example 3 in Sec. 13.3),
and u(cid:2)x2(cid:3)y2 and v(cid:2)2xy satisfy (1), namely, u (cid:2)2x(cid:2)v as well as u (cid:2)
x y y
(cid:3)2y(cid:2)(cid:3)v . More examples will follow.

THEOREM 1 Cauchy–Riemann Equations
Let f(z)(cid:2)u(x, y)(cid:4)iv(x, y) be defined and continuous in some neighborhood of a
point z(cid:2)x(cid:4)iy and differentiable at z itself. Then, at that point, the first-order
partial derivatives of u and v exist and satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations (1).
Hence, iff(z)is analytic in a domain D, those partial derivatives exist and satisfy
(1) at all points of D.
4The French mathematician AUGUSTIN-LOUIS CAUCHY (see Sec. 2.5) and the German mathematicians
BERNHARD RIEMANN (1826–1866) and KARL WEIERSTRASS (1815–1897; see also Sec. 15.5) are the
founders of complex analysis. Riemann received his Ph.D. (in 1851) under Gauss (Sec. 5.4) at Göttingen, where
he also taught until he died, when he was only 39 years old. He introduced the concept of the integral as it is
used in basic calculus courses, and made important contributions to differential equations, number theory, and
mathematical physics. He also developed the so-called Riemannian geometry, which is the mathematical
foundation of Einstein’s theory of relativity; see Ref. [GenRef9] in App. 1.

PROOF By assumption, the derivative f (z) at z exists. It is given by
f(z (cid:4) ¢z) (cid:3)f(z)
(2) fr (z)(cid:2) lim .
¢z:0 ¢z
The idea of the proof is very simple. By the definition of a limit in complex (Sec. 13.3),
we can let ¢zapproach zero along any path in a neighborhood of z. Thus we may choose
the two paths I and II in Fig. 335 and equate the results. By comparing the real parts we
shall obtain the first Cauchy–Riemann equation and by comparing the imaginary parts the
second. The technical details are as follows.
We write ¢z(cid:2) ¢x(cid:4)i ¢y. Then z(cid:4) ¢z(cid:2)x(cid:4) ¢x(cid:4)i(y(cid:4) ¢y), and in terms of u
and v the derivative in (2) becomes
[u(x(cid:4) ¢x, y(cid:4) ¢y)(cid:4)iv(x(cid:4) ¢x, y(cid:4) ¢y)] (cid:3)[u(x, y)(cid:4)iv(x, y)]
(3) fr (z)(cid:2) lim .
¢z:0 ¢x(cid:4)i¢y
We first choose path I in Fig. 335. Thus we let ¢y:0 first and then ¢x:0. After ¢y
is zero, ¢z(cid:2) ¢x. Then (3) becomes, if we first write the two u-terms and then the two
v-terms,
u(x(cid:4) ¢x, y)(cid:3)u(x, y) v(x(cid:4) ¢x, y)(cid:3)v(x, y)

Since f (z) exists, the two real limits on the right exist. By definition, they are the partial

derivatives of uand v with respect to x. Hence the derivative f(z) of f(z) can be written
(4) fr (z)(cid:2)u (cid:4)iv .
x x
Similarly, if we choose path II in Fig. 335, we let ¢x:0first and then ¢y:0. After
¢x is zero, ¢z(cid:2)i ¢y, so that from (3) we now obtain
u(x, y(cid:4) ¢y)(cid:3)u(x, y) v(x, y(cid:4) ¢y)(cid:3)v(x, y)

The existence of the derivative f(z)thus implies the existence of the four partial derivatives

Formulas (4) and (5) are also quite practical for calculating derivatives f(z),as we shall see.
EXAMPLE 1 Cauchy–Riemann Equations
f(z)(cid:2)z2 is analytic for all z. It follows that the Cauchy–Riemann equations must be satisfied (as we have
verified above).
For f (z)(cid:2)z(cid:2)x(cid:3)iywe have u(cid:2)x, v(cid:2)(cid:3)yand see that the second Cauchy–Riemann equation is satisfied,
u (cid:2)(cid:3)v (cid:2)0,but the first is not: u (cid:2)1(cid:5)v (cid:2)(cid:3)1.We conclude that f(z)(cid:2)zis not analytic, confirming

Example 4 of Sec. 13.3. Note the savings in calculation!
The Cauchy–Riemann equations are fundamental because they are not only necessary but
also sufficient for a function to be analytic. More precisely, the following theorem holds.
THEOREM 2 Cauchy–Riemann Equations
If two real-valued continuous functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) of two real variables x
and y have continuous first partial derivatives that satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann
equations in some domain D, then the complex functionf(z)(cid:2)u(x, y) (cid:4)iv(x, y)is
analytic in D.
The proof is more involved than that of Theorem 1 and we leave it optional (see App. 4).
Theorems 1 and 2 are of great practical importance, since, by using the Cauchy–Riemann
equations, we can now easily find out whether or not a given complex function is analytic.
EXAMPLE 2 Cauchy–Riemann Equations. Exponential Function
Is f(z)(cid:2)u(x, y)(cid:4)iv(x, y)(cid:2)ex(cos y(cid:4)i sin y)analytic?
Solution. We have u(cid:2)excos y, v(cid:2)ex sin yand by differentiation
u (cid:2)ex cos y, v (cid:2)ex cos y
x y
u (cid:2)(cid:3)ex sin y, v (cid:2)ex sin y.

We see that the Cauchy–Riemann equations are satisfied and conclude that f(z) is analytic for all z. (f(z) will
be the complex analog of exknown from calculus.) (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 3 An Analytic Function of Constant Absolute Value Is Constant
The Cauchy–Riemann equations also help in deriving general properties of analytic functions.
For instance, show that if f(z)is analytic in a domain Dand ƒf(z)ƒ (cid:2)k(cid:2)constin D, then f(z)(cid:2)constin
D. (We shall make crucial use of this in Sec. 18.6 in the proof of Theorem 3.)

Laplace’s Equation. Harmonic Functions
The great importance of complex analysis in engineering mathematics results mainly from
the fact that both the real part and the imaginary part of an analytic function satisfy Laplace’s
equation, the most important PDE of physics. It occurs in gravitation, electrostatics, fluid
flow, heat conduction, and other applications (see Chaps. 12 and 18).
THEOREM 3 Laplace’s Equation
If f(z)(cid:2)u(x, y)(cid:4)iv(x, y) is analytic in a domain D, then both u and v satisfy
Laplace’s equation

x y y x
(10) u (cid:2)v , u (cid:2)(cid:3)v .

Now the derivative of an analytic function is itself analytic, as we shall prove later (in
Sec. 14.4). This implies that u and v have continuous partial derivatives of all orders; in
particular, the mixed second derivatives are equal: v (cid:2)v . By adding (10) we thus
yx xy
obtain (8). Similarly, (9) is obtained by differentiating u (cid:2)v with respect to y and
x y
u (cid:2)(cid:3)v with respect to x and subtracting, using u (cid:2)u . (cid:2)
y x xy yx
Solutions of Laplace’s equation having continuoussecond-order partial derivatives are called
harmonic functionsand their theory is called potential theory(see also Sec. 12.11). Hence
the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function are harmonic functions.

SEC. 13.4 Cauchy–Riemann Equations. Laplace’s Equation 629
If two harmonic functions uand vsatisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations in a domain
D, they are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function f in D. Then v is said to
be a harmonic conjugate function of u in D. (Of course, this has absolutely nothing to
do with the use of “conjugate” for z.)
EXAMPLE 4 How to Find a Harmonic Conjugate Function by the Cauchy–Riemann Equations
Verify that u(cid:2)x2(cid:3)y2(cid:3)yis harmonic in the whole complex plane and find a harmonic conjugate function

v (cid:2)u (cid:2)2x, v (cid:2)(cid:3)u (cid:2)2y(cid:4)1.

Integrating the first equation with respect to yand differentiating the result with respect to x, we obtain
dh
v(cid:2)2xy(cid:4)h(x), v (cid:2)2y(cid:4) .
x dx
A comparison with the second equation shows that dh dx(cid:2)1.This gives h(x)(cid:2)x(cid:4)c. Hence v(cid:2)2xy(cid:4)x(cid:4)c

(cany real constant) is the most general harmonic conjugate of the given u. The corresponding analytic function is
f(z)(cid:2)u(cid:4)iv(cid:2)x2(cid:3)y2(cid:3)y(cid:4)i(2xy(cid:4)x(cid:4)c)(cid:2)z2(cid:4)iz(cid:4)ic. (cid:2)
Example 4 illustrates that a conjugate of a given harmonic function is uniquely determined
up to an arbitrary real additive constant.
The Cauchy–Riemann equations are the most important equations in this chapter. Their
relation to Laplace’s equation opens a wide range of engineering and physical applications,
as shown in Chap. 18.

Exponential Function
In the remaining sections of this chapter we discuss the basic elementary complex
functions, the exponential function, trigonometric functions, logarithm, and so on. They
will be counterparts to the familiar functions of calculus, to which they reduce when z(cid:2)x
is real. They are indispensable throughout applications, and some of them have interesting
properties not shared by their real counterparts.
We begin with one of the most important analytic functions, the complex exponential
function
ez, also written exp z.
The definition of ez in terms of the real functions ex, cos y, and sin y is
(1) ez(cid:2)ex(cos y (cid:4)i sin y).
This definition is motivated by the fact the ezextendsthe real exponential function exof
calculus in a natural fashion. Namely:
(A) ez(cid:2)ex for real z(cid:2)x because cos y (cid:2)1 and sin y (cid:2)0 when y(cid:2)0.
(B) ez is analytic for all z. (Proved in Example 2 of Sec. 13.4.)
(C) The derivative of ez is ez, that is,
(2) (ez)r (cid:2)ez.
This follows from (4) in Sec. 13.4,
(ez)r (cid:2)(ex cos y) (cid:4)i(ex sin y) (cid:2)ex cos y (cid:4)iex sin y (cid:2)ez.
x x
REMARK. This definition provides for a relatively simple discussion. We could define ez
by the familiar series 1(cid:4)x(cid:4)x2 2!(cid:4)x3 3!(cid:4) Á with x replaced by z, but we would

then have to discuss complex series at this very early stage. (We will show the connection
in Sec. 15.4.)
Further Properties. A function f(z)that is analytic for all zis called an entire function.
Thus, ez is entire. Just as in calculus the functional relation

SEC. 13.5 Exponential Function 631
holds for any z (cid:2)x (cid:4)iy and z (cid:2)x (cid:4)iy . Indeed, by (1),
1 1 1 2 2 2
ez1ez2(cid:2)ex1(cos y 1(cid:4)i sin y 1) ex2(cos y 2(cid:4)i sin y 2).
Since ex1ex2(cid:2) ex1(cid:4)x2for these realfunctions, by an application of the addition formulas
for the cosine and sine functions (similar to that in Sec. 13.2) we see that
ez1ez2(cid:2)ex1(cid:4)x2[cos ( y 1(cid:4)y 2)(cid:4)i sin ( y 1(cid:4)y 2)] (cid:2)ez1(cid:4)z2
as asserted. An interesting special case of (3) is z (cid:2)x, z (cid:2)iy; then
1 2
(4) ez(cid:2)exeiy.
Furthermore, for z(cid:2)iy we have from (1) the so-called Euler formula
(5) eiy(cid:2)cos y (cid:4)i sin y.
Hence the polar formof a complex number, z(cid:2)r(cos u (cid:4)i sin u), may now be written
(6) z(cid:2)reiu.
From (5) we obtain
(7) e2pi(cid:2)1
as well as the important formulas (verify!)
(8) epi >2(cid:2)i, epi(cid:2)(cid:3)1, e(cid:3)pi >2(cid:2)(cid:3)i, e(cid:3)pi(cid:2)(cid:3)1.
Another consequence of (5) is
(9) ƒeiyƒ (cid:2) ƒcos y (cid:4)i sin yƒ (cid:2) 2cos2 y(cid:4)sin2 y(cid:2)1.
That is, for pure imaginary exponents, the exponential function has absolute value 1, a
result you should remember. From (9) and (1),
(10) ƒezƒ (cid:2)ex. Hence arg ez(cid:2)y (cid:6) 2np (n(cid:2)0, 1, 2,Á ),
since ƒezƒ (cid:2)ex shows that (1) is actually ez in polar form.
From ƒezƒ (cid:2)ex(cid:5)0 in (10) we see that
(11) ex(cid:5)0 for all z.
So here we have an entire function that never vanishes, in contrast to (nonconstant)
polynomials, which are also entire (Example 5 in Sec. 13.3) but always have a zero, as
is proved in algebra.

Periodicity of exwith period 2(cid:6)i,
(12)
ez(cid:4)2pi(cid:2)ez
for all z
is a basic property that follows from (1) and the periodicity of cos y and sin y. Hence all
the values that w(cid:2)ezcan assume are already assumed in the horizontal strip of width 2p
(13) (cid:3)p(cid:7)y(cid:8)p (Fig. 336).
This infinite strip is called a fundamental region of ez.
EXAMPLE 1 Function Values. Solution of Equations
Computation of values from (1) provides no problem. For instance,
e1.4(cid:3)0.6i(cid:2)e1.4(cos 0.6(cid:3)i sin 0.6)(cid:2)4.055(0.8253(cid:3)0.5646i)(cid:2)3.347(cid:3)2.289i
ƒe1.4(cid:3)1.6iƒ (cid:2)e1.4(cid:2)4.055, Arg e1.4–0.6i(cid:2)(cid:3)0.6.
To illustrate (3), take the product of
e2(cid:4)i(cid:2)e2(cos 1(cid:4)i sin 1) and e4(cid:3)i(cid:2)e4(cos 1(cid:3)i sin 1)
and verify that it equals e2e4(cos2 1(cid:4)sin2 1)(cid:2)e6(cid:2)e(2(cid:4)i)(cid:4)(4(cid:3)i).
To solve the equation ez(cid:2)3(cid:4)4i, note first that ƒezƒ (cid:2)ex(cid:2)5, x(cid:2)ln 5(cid:2)1.609 is the real part of all
solutions. Now, since ex(cid:2)5,
ex cos y(cid:2)3, ex sin y(cid:2)4, cos y(cid:2)0.6, sin y(cid:2)0.8, y(cid:2)0.927.
Ans.z(cid:2)1.609(cid:4)0.927i (cid:6) 2npi (n(cid:2)0, 1, 2,Á ).These are infinitely many solutions (due to the periodicity
of ez). They lie on the vertical line x(cid:2)1.609at a distance 2pfrom their neighbors. (cid:2)
To summarize: many properties of ez(cid:2)exp z parallel those of ex; an exception is the
periodicity of ez with 2pi, which suggested the concept of a fundamental region. Keep
in mind that ez is an entire function. (Do you still remember what that means?)

Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions.
Euler’s Formula
Just as we extended the real ex to the complex ez in Sec. 13.5, we now want to extend
the familiar real trigonometric functions to complex trigonometric functions. We can do
this by the use of the Euler formulas (Sec. 13.5)
eix(cid:2)cos x (cid:4)i sin x, e(cid:3)ix (cid:2)cos x (cid:3)i sin x.
By addition and subtraction we obtain for the real cosine and sine
1
cos x (cid:2)1(eix(cid:4)e(cid:3)ix), sin x (cid:2) (eix(cid:3)e(cid:3)ix).
2 2i
This suggests the following definitions for complex values z(cid:2)x(cid:4)iy:
1
(1) cos z (cid:2)1(eiz(cid:4)e(cid:3)iz), sin z (cid:2) (eiz(cid:3)e(cid:3)iz).
2 2i
It is quite remarkable that here in complex, functions come together that are unrelated in
real. This is not an isolated incident but is typical of the general situation and shows the
advantage of working in complex.
Furthermore, as in calculus we define
sin z cos z
(2) tan z (cid:2) , cot z (cid:2)
cos z sin z
and
1 1
(3) sec z (cid:2) , csc z (cid:2) .
cos z sin z
Since ez is entire, cos z and sin z are entire functions. tan z and sec z are not entire; they
are analytic except at the points where cos zis zero; and cot zand csc zare analytic except
c13.qxd 10/30/10 2:14 PM Page 634
634 CHAP. 13 Complex Numbers and Functions. Complex Differentiation
where sin zis zero. Formulas for the derivatives follow readily from (ez)r (cid:2)ezand (1)–(3);
as in calculus,
(4) (cos z)r (cid:2)(cid:3)sin z, (sin z)r (cid:2)cos z, (tan z)r (cid:2)sec2 z,
etc. Equation (1) also shows that Euler’s formula is valid in complex:
(5) eiz(cid:2)cos z (cid:4)i sin z for all z.
The real and imaginary parts of cos zand sin zare needed in computing values, and they
also help in displaying properties of our functions. We illustrate this with a typical example.
EXAMPLE 1 Real and Imaginary Parts. Absolute Value. Periodicity
Show that
(a) cos z(cid:2)cos x cosh y(cid:3)i sin x sinh y
(6)
(b) sin z(cid:2)sin x cosh y(cid:4)i cos x sinh y
and
(a) ƒcos zƒ2(cid:2)cos2 x(cid:4)sinh2 y
(7)
(b) ƒsin zƒ2(cid:2)sin2 x(cid:4)sinh2 y
and give some applications of these formulas.
Solution. From (1),
cos z(cid:2)1(ei(x(cid:4)iy)(cid:4)e(cid:3)i(x(cid:4)iy))
2
(cid:2)1e(cid:3)y(cos x(cid:4)isin x)(cid:4)1ey(cos x(cid:3)i sin x)
2 2
(cid:2)1(ey(cid:4)e(cid:3)y) cos x(cid:3)1i(ey(cid:3)e(cid:3)y) sin x.
2 2
This yields (6a) since, as is known from calculus,
(8) cosh y(cid:2)1(ey(cid:4)e(cid:3)y), sinh y(cid:2)1(ey(cid:3)e(cid:3)y);
2 2
(6b) is obtained similarly. From (6a) and cosh2 y(cid:2)1(cid:4)sinh2 ywe obtain
ƒcos zƒ2(cid:2)(cos2 x) (1(cid:4)sinh2 y)(cid:4)sin2 x sinh2 y.
Since sin2 x(cid:4)cos2 x(cid:2)1,this gives (7a), and (7b) is obtained similarly.
For instance, cos (2(cid:4)3i)(cid:2)cos 2 cosh 3(cid:3)i sin 2 sinh 3(cid:2)(cid:3)4.190(cid:3)9.109i.
From (6) we see that sin zand cos zare periodic with period 2(cid:6),just as in real. Periodicity of tan zand cot z
with period pnow follows.
Formula (7) points to an essential difference between the real and the complex cosine and sine; whereas
ƒcos xƒ (cid:8)1and ƒsin xƒ (cid:8)1,the complex cosine and sine functions are no longer boundedbut approach infinity
in absolute value as y:(cid:12),since then sinh y:(cid:12)in (7). (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 2 Solutions of Equations. Zeros of cos z and sin z
Solve (a) cos z(cid:2)5(which has no real solution!), (b) cos z(cid:2)0,(c) sin z(cid:2)0.
Solution. (a) e2iz(cid:3)10eiz(cid:4)1(cid:2)0from (1) by multiplication by eiz. This is a quadratic equation in eiz,
with solutions (rounded off to 3 decimals)
eiz(cid:2)e(cid:3)y(cid:4)ix(cid:2)5 (cid:6) 125(cid:3)1(cid:2)9.899 and 0.101.

Can you obtain this from (6a)?

(cid:2)
Hence the only zeros of cos zand sin zare those of the real cosine and sine functions.
General formulas for the real trigonometric functions continue to hold for complex
values. This follows immediately from the definitions. We mention in particular the
addition rules
cos (z (cid:6) z )(cid:2)cos z cos z (cid:13)sin z sin z
1 2 1 2 1 2
(9)
sin (z (cid:6) z )(cid:2)sin z cos z (cid:6) sin z cos z
1 2 1 2 2 1
and the formula
(10) cos2 z (cid:4)sin2 z(cid:2)1.
Some further useful formulas are included in the problem set.
Hyperbolic Functions
The complex hyperbolic cosine and sine are defined by the formulas
(11) cosh
z(cid:2)1(ez(cid:4)e(cid:3)z),
sinh
z(cid:2)1(ez(cid:3)e(cid:3)z).
2 2
This is suggested by the familiar definitions for a real variable [see (8)]. These functions
are entire, with derivatives
(12) (cosh z)r (cid:2)sinh z, (sinh z)r (cid:2)cosh z,
as in calculus. The other hyperbolic functions are defined by
sinh z cosh z
tanh z (cid:2) , coth z (cid:2) ,
cosh z sinh z
(13)
1 1
sech z (cid:2) , csch z (cid:2) .
cosh z sinh z
Complex Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions Are Related.If in (11), we replace z
by iz and then use (1), we obtain
(14) cosh iz(cid:2)cos z, sinh iz (cid:2)isin z.
Similarly, if in (1) we replace z by iz and then use (11), we obtain conversely
(15) cos iz (cid:2)cosh z, sin iz (cid:2)i sinh z.
Here we have another case of unrelatedreal functions that have relatedcomplex analogs,
pointing again to the advantage of working in complex in order to get both a more unified
formalism and a deeper understanding of special functions. This is one of the main reasons
for the importance of complex analysis to the engineer and physicist.

Logarithm. General Power. Principal Value
We finally introduce the complex logarithm, which is more complicated than the real
logarithm (which it includes as a special case) and historically puzzled mathematicians
for some time (so if you first get puzzled—which need not happen!—be patient and work
through this section with extra care).
The natural logarithmof z(cid:2)x(cid:4)iyis denoted by ln z(sometimes also by log z) and
is defined as the inverse of the exponential function; that is, w(cid:2)ln zis defined for z(cid:5)0
by the relation
ew(cid:2)z.
(Note that z(cid:2)0is impossible, since ew(cid:5)0for all w; see Sec. 13.5.) If we set w(cid:2)u(cid:4)iv
and z(cid:2)reiu, this becomes
ew(cid:2)eu(cid:4)iv(cid:2)reiu.
Now, from Sec. 13.5, we know that eu(cid:4)iv has the absolute value eu and the argument v.
These must be equal to the absolute value and argument on the right:
eu (cid:2)r, v(cid:2)u.
c13.qxd 10/30/10 2:14 PM Page 637
SEC. 13.7 Logarithm. General Power. Principal Value 637
eu (cid:2)r gives u(cid:2)ln r, where ln r is the familiar real natural logarithm of the positive
number r(cid:2) ƒzƒ. Hence w(cid:2)u(cid:4)iv(cid:2)ln z is given by
(1) ln z (cid:2)ln r (cid:4)iu (r (cid:2) ƒzƒ (cid:10)0, u(cid:2)arg z).
Now comes an important point (without analog in real calculus). Since the argument of
z is determined only up to integer multiples of 2p, the complex natural logarithm
ln z (z(cid:7)0) is infinitely many-valued.
The value of ln zcorresponding to the principal value Arg z(see Sec. 13.2) is denoted
by Ln z (Ln with capital L) and is called the principal value of ln z. Thus
(2) Ln z (cid:2)ln ƒzƒ (cid:4)i Arg z (z(cid:5)0).
The uniqueness of Arg z for given z ((cid:5)0) implies that Ln z is single-valued, that is, a
function in the usual sense. Since the other values of arg zdiffer by integer multiples of 2p,
the other values of ln zare given by
(3) In z (cid:2)Ln z (cid:6) 2npi (n(cid:2)1, 2,Á ).
They all have the same real part, and their imaginary parts differ by integer multiples
of 2p.
If z is positive real, then Arg z (cid:2)0, and Ln z becomes identical with the real natural
logarithm known from calculus. If z is negative real (so that the natural logarithm of
calculus is not defined!), then Arg z(cid:2)p and
Ln z (cid:2)ln ƒzƒ (cid:4)pi (z negative real).
From (1) and eln r(cid:2)r for positive real r we obtain
(4a) eln z(cid:2)z
as expected, but since arg (ez)(cid:2)y (cid:6) 2np is multivalued, so is
(4b) ln (ez)(cid:2)z (cid:6) 2npi, n(cid:2)0, 1,Á .

General Powers
General powers of a complex number z(cid:2)x(cid:4)iy are defined by the formula
(7) zc(cid:2)ec ln z (c complex, z(cid:5)0).
Since ln zis infinitely many-valued, zcwill, in general, be multivalued. The particular value
zc(cid:2)ec Ln z
is called the principal value of zc.
If c(cid:2)n(cid:2)1, 2,Á ,then znis single-valued and identical with the usual nth power of z.
If c(cid:2)(cid:3)1, (cid:3)2,Á , the situation is similar.
If c(cid:2)1 n, where n(cid:2)2, 3,Á , then

of the nth root, in agreement with the result in Sec. 13.2. If c(cid:2)p q, the quotient of two

positive integers, the situation is similar, and zc has only finitely many distinct values.
However, if c is real irrational or genuinely complex, then zc is infinitely many-valued.

It is a convention that for real positive z(cid:2)x the expression zc means ec ln x where ln x
is the elementary real natural logarithm (that is, the principal value Ln z (z(cid:2)x(cid:10)0) in
the sense of our definition). Also, if z(cid:2)e, the base of the natural logarithm, zc(cid:2)ec is
conventionally regarded as the unique value obtained from (1) in Sec. 13.5.

analytic except at certain points, and one of them (ln z) splitting up into infinitely many
functions, each analytic except at 0 and on the negative real axis.

Complex Integration
Chapter 13 laid the groundwork for the study of complex analysis, covered complex num-
bers in the complex plane, limits, and differentiation, and introduced the most important
concept of analyticity. A complex function isanalytic in some domain if it is differentiable
in that domain. Complex analysis deals with such functions and their applications. The
Cauchy–Riemann equations, in Sec. 13.4, were the heart of Chapter 13 and allowed a means
of checking whether a function is indeed analytic. In that section, we also saw that analytic
functions satisfy Laplace’s equation, the most important PDE in physics.
We now consider the next part of complex calculus, that is, we shall discuss the first
approach to complex integration. It centers around the very important Cauchy integral
theorem(also called the Cauchy–Goursat theorem) in Sec. 14.2. This theorem is important
because it allows, through its implied Cauchy integral formulaof Sec. 14.3, the evaluation
of integrals having an analytic integrand. Furthermore, the Cauchy integral formula shows
the surprising result that analytic functions have derivatives of all orders. Hence, in this
respect, complex analytic functions behave much more simply than real-valued functions
of real variables, which may have derivatives only up to a certain order.
Complex integration is attractive for several reasons. Some basic properties of analytic
functions are difficult to prove by other methods. This includes the existence of derivatives
of all orders just discussed. A main practical reason for the importance of integration in
the complex plane is that such integration can evaluate certain real integrals that appear
in applications and that are not accessible by real integral calculus.
Finally, complex integration is used in connection with special functions, such as
gamma functions (consult [GenRef1]), the error function, and various polynomials (see
[GenRef10]). These functions are applied to problems in physics.
The second approach to complex integration is integration by residues, which we shall
cover in Chapter 16.

Line Integral in the Complex Plane
As in calculus, in complex analysis we distinguish between definite integrals and indefinite
integrals or antiderivatives. Here an indefinite integral is a function whose derivative
equals a given analytic function in a region. By inverting known differentiation formulas
we may find many types of indefinite integrals.
Complex definite integrals are called (complex) line integrals. They are written
(cid:2)
f(z) dz.
C

c14.qxd 11/1/10 6:02 PM Page 644
644 CHAP. 14 Complex Integration
Here the integrand f(z) is integrated over a given curve C or a portion of it (an arc, but
we shall say “curve” in either case, for simplicity). This curve Cin the complex plane is
called the path of integration. We may represent C by a parametric representation
(1) z(t)(cid:2)x(t)(cid:2)iy(t) (a(cid:4)t(cid:4)b).
The sense of increasing tis called the positive senseon C, and we say that Cis oriented
by (1).
For instance, z(t)(cid:2)t(cid:5)3it (0 (cid:4)t(cid:4)2)gives a portion (a segment) of the line y(cid:2)3x.
The function z(t)(cid:2)4 cos t (cid:5)4i sin t ((cid:6)p(cid:4)t(cid:4)p)represents the circle ƒzƒ (cid:2)4, and so
on. More examples follow below.
We assume Cto be a smooth curve, that is, Chas a continuous and nonzero derivative

at each point. Geometrically this means that C has everywhere a continuously turning

Here we use a dot since a prime denotes the derivative with respect to z.
Definition of the Complex Line Integral
This is similar to the method in calculus. Let C be a smooth curve in the complex plane
given by (1), and let f(z)be a continuous function given (at least) at each point of C. We
now subdivide (we “partition”) the interval a(cid:4)t(cid:4)b in (1) by points
t ((cid:2) a), t , Á , t , t ((cid:2) b)

We do this for each n(cid:2)2, 3,Á in a completely independent manner, but so that the
greatest ƒ¢t ƒ (cid:2) ƒt (cid:6)t ƒ approaches zero as n:(cid:7). This implies that the greatest
m m m(cid:2)1
ƒ¢z ƒ also approaches zero. Indeed, it cannot exceed the length of the arc of C from
m
z to z and the latter goes to zero since the arc length of the smooth curve C is a
m(cid:2)1 m

continuous function of t. The limit of the sequence of complex numbers S , S , thus

obtained is called the line integral (or simply the integral) of f(z) over the path of
integration C with the orientation given by (1). This line integral is denoted by
(cid:2) (cid:3)

C C
if C is a closed path (one whose terminal point Z coincides with its initial point z , as
0
for a circle or for a curve shaped like an 8).
General Assumption. All paths of integration for complex line integrals are assumed to
bepiecewise smooth, that is, they consist of finitely many smooth curves joined end to end.

Existence of the Complex Line Integral
Our assumptions that f(z) is continuous and C is piecewise smooth imply the existence
of the line integral (3). This can be seen as follows.
As in the preceding chapter let us write f(z)(cid:2)u(x, y) (cid:5)iv(x, y). We also set
z (cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:5)ih and ¢z (cid:2) ¢x (cid:5)i¢y .
m m m m m m
Then (2) may be written

where u(cid:2)u(z , h ), v (cid:2)v(z , h ) and we sum over m from 1 to n. Performing the
m m m m
multiplication, we may now split up S into four sums:
n
S n(cid:2) a u ¢x m(cid:6) a v ¢y m(cid:5)i [ au ¢y m(cid:5) a v ¢x m] .
These sums are real. Since f is continuous, u and v are continuous. Hence, if we let n
approach infinity in the aforementioned way, then the greatest ¢x and ¢y will approach
m m
zero and each sum on the right becomes a real line integral:

This shows that under our assumptions on fand Cthe line integral (3) exists and its value

First Evaluation Method:
Indefinite Integration and Substitution of Limits

known formula

It is simpler than the next method, but it is suitable for analytic functions only. To
formulate it, we need the following concept of general interest.
A domain D is called simply connected if every simple closed curve (closed curve
without self-intersections) encloses only points of D.
For instance, a circular disk is simply connected, whereas an annulus (Sec. 13.3) is not
simply connected. (Explain!)

SEC. 14.1 Line Integral in the Complex Plane 647
THEOREM 1 Indefinite Integration of Analytic Functions
Let f(z)be analytic in a simply connected domain D. Then there exists an indefinite
integral of f(z) in the domain D, that is, an analytic function F(z) such that
Fr (z)(cid:2)f(z)in D, and for all paths in D joining two points z and z in D we have

z0
(Note that we can write z and z instead of C, since we get the same value for all
0 1
those C from z to z .)
0 1
This theorem will be proved in the next section.
Simple connectedness is quite essential in Theorem 1, as we shall see in Example 5.
Since analytic functions are our main concern, and since differentiation formulas will often
help in finding F(z)for a given
f(z)(cid:2)Fr
(z),the present method is of great practical interest.
If f(z) is entire (Sec. 13.5), we can take for D the complex plane (which is certainly
simply connected).

COMMENT. In (7) and (8) of the existence proof of the complex line integral we referred
to real line integrals. If one wants to avoid this, one can take (10) as a definition of the
complex line integral.

(C) Substitute z(t) fo#r every z in f (z) (hence x(t) for x and y(t) for y).
(D) Integrate f[z(t)]z(t) over t from a to b.

z(t)(cid:2)cos t(cid:5)i sin t(cid:2)eit (0(cid:4)t(cid:4)2p),
so that counterclockwise integration corresponds to an increase of tfrom 0 to 2p.

(C)By substitution, f(z(t))(cid:2)1 z(t)(cid:2)e(cid:2)it.

Dependence on path.Now comes a vebry important fact. If we integrate a given function
f(z) from a point z to a point z along different paths, the integrals will in general have
0 1
different values. In other words, a complex line integral depends not only on the endpoints
of the path but in general also on the path itself. The next example gives a first impression
of this, and a systematic discussion follows in the next section.

Bounds for Integrals. ML-Inequality
There will be a frequent need for estimating the absolute value of complex line integrals.
The basic formula is
(cid:2)
(13) f(z) dz (cid:4)ML (ML-inequality);
C
L is the length of C and M a constant such that ƒf(z)ƒ (cid:4)M everywhere on C.
2 2
PROOF Taking the absolute value in (2) and applying the generalized inequality (6*)in Sec. 13.2,
we obtain
n n n
ƒS nƒ (cid:2) a f (z m) ¢z m (cid:4) a ƒ f (z m)ƒƒ¢z mƒ (cid:4)Ma ƒ¢z mƒ.
m(cid:2)1 m(cid:2)1 m(cid:2)1
Now ƒ¢z ƒ is the length of the chord whose endpoints are z and z (see Fig. 340).
m m(cid:2)1 m
Hence the sum on the right represents the length L* of the broken line of chords whose
2 2
endpoints are z , z ,Á , z ((cid:2) Z). If napproaches infinity in such a way that the greatest
0 1 n
ƒ¢t ƒ and thus ƒ¢z ƒ approach zero, then L*approaches the length Lof the curve C, by
m m
the definition of the length of a curve. From this the inequality (13) follows. (cid:2)
We cannot see from (13) how close to the bound ML the actual absolute value of the
integral is, but this will be no handicap in applying (13). For the time being we explain
the practical use of (13) by a simple example.

Cauchy’s Integral Theorem
This section is the focal point of the chapter. We have just seen in Sec. 14.1 that a line
integral of a function f(z)generally depends not merely on the endpoints of the path, but
also on the choice of the path itself. This dependence often complicates situations. Hence
conditions under which this does not occur are of considerable importance. Namely, if
f(z)is analytic in a domain Dand Dis simply connected (see Sec. 14.1 and also below),
then the integral will not depend on the choice of a path between given points. This result
(Theorem 2) follows from Cauchy’s integral theorem, along with other basic consequences
that make Cauchy’s integral theorem the most important theorem in this chapter and
fundamental throughout complex analysis.
Let us continue our discussion of simple connectedness which we started in Sec. 14.1.
1. A simple closed pathis a closed path (defined in Sec. 14.1) that does not intersect
or touch itself as shown in Fig. 345. For example, a circle is simple, but a curve
shaped like an 8 is not simple.
Simple Simple Not simple Not simple
Fig. 345. Closed paths
2. A simply connected domainDin the complex plane is a domain (Sec. 13.3) such
that every simple closed path in Dencloses only points of D. Examples:The interior
of a circle (“open disk”), ellipse, or any simple closed curve. A domain that is not
simply connected is called multiply connected.Examples:An annulus (Sec. 13.3),
a disk without the center, for example, 0(cid:3) ƒzƒ (cid:3)1. See also Fig. 346.
More precisely, a bounded domainD(that is, a domain that lies entirely in some
circle about the origin) is called p-fold connectedif its boundary consists of p closed

where “hole” may also mean a segment or even a single point. Hence an annulus

PROOF Cauchy proved his integral theorem under the additional assumption that the derivative

Since f(z) is analytic in D, its derivative f (z) exists in D. Since f (z) is assumed to be

in D. Hence Green’s theorem (Sec. 10.4) (with uand (cid:6)vinstead of F and F ) is applicable

where R is the region bounded by C. The second Cauchy–Riemann equation (Sec. 13.4)
shows that the integrand on the right is identically zero. Hence the integral on the left is
zero. In the same fashion it follows by the use of the first Cauchy–Riemann equation that
the last integral in the above formula is zero. This completes Cauchy’s proof. (cid:2)
Goursat’s proofwithout the condition thatfr (z)is continuous1is much more complicated.
We leave it optional and include it in App. 4.
1ÉDOUARD GOURSAT (1858–1936), French mathematician who made important contributions to complex
analysis and PDEs. Cauchy published the theorem in 1825. The removal of that condition by Goursat (see Transactions
Amer. Math Soc., vol. 1, 1900) is quite important because, for instance, derivatives of analytic functions are also
analytic. Because of this, Cauchy’s integral theorem is also called Cauchy–Goursat theorem.

SEC. 14.2 Cauchy’s Integral Theorem 655
Independence of Path
We know from the preceding section that the value of a line integral of a given function
f(z) from a point z to a point z will in general depend on the path C over which we
1 2
integrate, not merely on z and z . It is important to characterize situations in which this
1 2
difficulty of path dependence does not occur. This task suggests the following concept.
We call an integral of f(z) independent of path in a domain D if for every z , z in D
1 2
its value depends (besides on f(z), of course) only on the initial point z and the terminal
1
point z , but not on the choice of the path C in D [so that every path in D from z to z
2 1 2
gives the same value of the integral of f(z)].
THEOREM 2 Independence of Path
If f(z) is analytic in a simply connected domain D, then the integral of f(z) is
independent of path in D.
PROOF Let z and z be any points in D. Consider two paths C and C in Dfrom z to z without
1 2 1 2 1 2
further common points, as in Fig. 348. Denote by C* the path C with the orientation
2 2
reversed (Fig. 349). Integrate from z over C to z and over C* back to z . This is a
1 1 2 2 1
simple closed path, and Cauchy’s theorem applies under our assumptions of the present
theorem and gives zero:
(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)
(2r ) f dz (cid:5) f dz (cid:2)0, thus f dz (cid:2)(cid:6) f dz.
C1 C2* C1 C2*
But the minus sign on the right disappears if we integrate in the reverse direction, from
z to z , which shows that the integrals of f(z) over C and C are equal,

Principle of Deformation of Path
This idea is related to path independence. We may imagine that the path C in (2) was
2
obtained from C by continuously moving C (with ends fixed!) until it coincides with
1 1
C . Figure 351 shows two of the infinitely many intermediate paths for which the integral
2
always retains its value (because of Theorem 2). Hence we may impose a continuous
deformation of the path of an integral, keeping the ends fixed. As long as our deforming
path always contains only points at which f(z) is analytic, the integral retains the same
value. This is called the principle of deformation of path.

Indeed, the circle ƒz(cid:6)z ƒ (cid:2)rin Example 6 of Sb ec. 14.1 can be continuously deformed in two steps into a path
0 (cid:2)
as just indicated, namely, by first deforming, say, one semicircle and then the other one. (Make a sketch).
Existence of Indefinite Integral
We shall now justify our indefinite integration method in the preceding section [formula
(9) in Sec. 14.1]. The proof will need Cauchy’s integral theorem.
THEOREM 3 Existence of Indefinite Integral
If f(z) is analytic in a simply connected domain D, then there exists an indefinite
integral F(z) of f(z) in D—thus, Fr (z)(cid:2)f(z)—which is analytic in D, and for all
paths in D joining any two points z and z in D, the integral of f(z) from z to z
0 1 0 1
can be evaluated by formula (9) in Sec. 14.1.
PROOF The conditions of Cauchy’s integral theorem are satisfied. Hence the line integral of f(z)
from any z in Dto any zin Dis independent of path in D. We keep z fixed. Then this
0 0
integral becomes a function of z, call if F(z),

SEC. 14.2 Cauchy’s Integral Theorem 657
which is uniquely determined. We show that this F(z) is analytic in D and Fr (z)(cid:2)f(z).
The idea of doing this is as follows. Using (4) we form the difference quotient
F(z(cid:5) ¢z) (cid:6)F(z) 1 (cid:2)z(cid:5)¢z (cid:2)z 1 (cid:2)z(cid:5)¢z
(5) (cid:2) f(z*) dz* (cid:6) f(z*) dz* (cid:2) f(z*) dz*.
¢z ¢z c d ¢z
z0 z0 z
We now subtract f(z)from (5) and show that the resulting expression approaches zero as
¢z:0. The details are as follows.
We keep zfixed. Then we choose z(cid:5) ¢zin Dso that the whole segment with endpoints
zand z(cid:5) ¢zis in D(Fig. 352). This can be done because Dis a domain, hence it contains
a neighborhood of z. We use this segment as the path of integration in (5). Now we subtract
f(z). This is a constant because z is kept fixed. Hence we can write
(cid:2)z(cid:5)¢z (cid:2)z(cid:5)¢z
1
(cid:2)z(cid:5)¢z
f(z) dz* (cid:2)f(z) dz*(cid:2)f(z) ¢z. Thus f(z)(cid:2) f(z) dz*.
¢z
z z z
By this trick and from (5) we get a single integral:
F(z(cid:5) ¢z) (cid:6)F(z) 1
(cid:2)z(cid:5)¢z
(cid:6)f(z)(cid:2) [ f(z*) (cid:6)f(z)] dz*.
¢z ¢z
z
Since f(z) is analytic, it is continuous (see Team Project (24d) in Sec. 13.3). An P(cid:12)0
being given, we can thus find a d(cid:12)0 such that ƒf(z*) (cid:6)f(z)ƒ (cid:3)P when ƒz*(cid:6)zƒ (cid:3)d.
Hence, letting ƒ¢zƒ (cid:3)d, we see that the ML-inequality (Sec. 14.1) yields
F(z (cid:5) ¢z) (cid:6)F(z) 1
(cid:2)z(cid:5)¢z

By the definition of limit and derivative, this proves that

Also, if Gr (z)(cid:2)f(z), then Fr (z)(cid:6)Gr (z)(cid:4)0 in D; hence F(z) (cid:6)G(z) is constant in D
(see Team Project 30 in Problem Set 13.4). That is, two indefinite integrals of f(z) can
differ only by a constant. The latter drops out in (9) of Sec. 14.1, so that we can use any
indefinite integral of f(z). This proves Theorem 3. (cid:2)
Cauchy’s Integral Theorem
for Multiply Connected Domains
Cauchy’s theorem applies to multiply connected domains. We first explain this for a
doubly connected domain D with outer boundary curve C and inner C (Fig. 353). If
1 2
a function f(z)is analytic in any domain D*that contains Dand its boundary curves, we
claim that

or not the full interior of C belongs to D*).

PROOF By two cuts C and C (Fig. 354) we cut D into two simply connected domains D and
1 2 1
D in which and on whose boundaries f(z)is analytic. By Cauchy’s integral theorem the
2
integral over the entire boundary of D (taken in the sense of the arrows in Fig. 354) is
1
zero, and so is the integral over the boundary of D , and thus their sum. In this sum the
(cid:2) (cid:2) 2
integrals over the cuts C and C cancel because we integrate over them in both
1 2
directions—this is the key—and we are left with the integrals over C (counterclockwise)

and C (clockwise; see Fig. 354); hence by reversing the integration over C (to
2 2
counterclockwise) we have
(cid:3) (cid:3)

and (6) follows. (cid:2)
For domains of higher connectivity the idea remains the same. Thus, for a triply connected
(cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)
domainwe use three cuts C , C , C (Fig. 355). Adding integrals as before, the integrals
1 2 3
over the cuts cancel and the sum of the integrals over C (counterclockwise) and C , C
1 2 3
(clockwise) is zero. Hence the integral over C equals the sum of the integrals over C
1 2
and C ,all three now taken counterclockwise. Similarly for quadruply connected domains,
3
and so on.

Cauchy’s Integral Formula
Cauchy’s integral theorem leads to Cauchy’s integral formula. This formula is useful for
evaluating integrals as shown in this section. It has other important roles, such as in proving
the surprising fact that analytic functions have derivatives of all orders, as shown in the
next section, and in showing that all analytic functions have a Taylor series representation
(to be seen in Sec. 15.4).

at z . Hence, by (6) in Sec. 14.2, we can replace C by a small circle K of radius r and
0
center z (Fig. 357), without altering the value of the integral. Since f(z)is analytic, it is
0
continuous (Team Project 24, Sec. 13.3). Hence, an P(cid:12)0 being given, we can find a

Derivatives of Analytic Functions
As mentioned, a surprising fact is that complex analytic functions have derivatives of all
orders. This differs completely from real calculus. Even if a real function is once
differentiable we cannot conclude that it is twice differentiable nor that any of its higher
derivatives exist. This makes the behavior of complex analytic functions simpler than real
functions in this aspect. To prove the surprising fact we use Cauchy’s integral formula.
THEOREM 1 Derivatives of an Analytic Function
If f(z) is analytic in a domain D, then it has derivatives of all orders in D, which
are then also analytic functions in D. The values of these derivatives at a point z
0
in D are given by the formulas

Cauchy’s Inequality. Liouville’s and Morera’s Theorems
We develop other general results about analytic functions, further showing the versatility

To gain a first impression of the importance of this inequality, let us prove a famous
theorem on entire functions (definition in Sec. 13.5). (For Liouville, see Sec. 11.5.)
THEOREM 2 Liouville’s Theorem
If an entire function is bounded in absolute value in the whole complex plane, then
this function must be a constant.

PROOF By assumption, ƒf(z)ƒ is bounded, say, ƒf(z)ƒ (cid:3)K for all z. Using (2), we see that
ƒfr (z )ƒ (cid:3)K r. Since f(z) is entire, this holds for every r, so that we can take r as large

the proof. (cid:2)
Another very interesting consequence of Theorem 1 is

is analytic in Dand Fr (z)(cid:2)f(z).In the proof we used only the continuity of f(z)and the
property that its integral around every closed path in D is zero; from these assumptions
we concluded that F(z) is analytic. By Theorem 1, the derivative of F(z) is analytic, that
is, f(z) is analytic in D, and Morera’s theorem is proved. (cid:2)
This completes Chapter 14.

Power Series, Taylor Series
In Chapter 14, we evaluated complex integrals directly by using Cauchy’s integral formula,
which was derived from the famous Cauchy integral theorem. We now shift from the
approach of Cauchy and Goursat to another approach of evaluating complex integrals,
that is, evaluating them by residue integration. This approach, discussed in Chapter 16,
first requires a thorough understanding of power series and, in particular, Taylor series.
(To develop the theory of residue integration, we still use Cauchy’s integral theorem!)
In this chapter, we focus on complex power series and in particular Taylor series. They
are analogs of real power series and Taylor series in calculus. Section 15.1 discusses
convergence tests for complex series, which are quite similar to those for real series. Thus,
if you are familiar with convergence tests from calculus, you may use Sec. 15.1 as a
reference section. The main results of this chapter are that complex power series represent
analytic functions, as shown in Sec. 15.3, and that, conversely, every analytic function
can be represented by power series, called a Taylor series, as shown in Sec. 15.4. The last
section (15.5) on uniform convergence is optional.
Prerequisite: Chaps. 13, 14.
Sections that may be omitted in a shorter course: 15.1, 15.5.

15.1
Sequences, Series, Convergence Tests
The basic concepts for complex sequences and series and tests for convergence and
divergence are very similar to those concepts in (real) calculus. Thus if you feel at home
with real sequences and series and want to take for granted that the ratio test also holds
in complex, skip this section and go to Section 15.2.
Sequences
The basic definitions are as in calculus. An infinite sequence or, briefly, a sequence, is
obtained by assigning to each positive integer na number z ,called a termof the sequence,
n
and is written
z , z
,Á
or {z , z

} or briefly {z }.

An application of Theorem 1 to the partial sums immediately relates the convergence
of a complex series to that of the two series of its real parts and of its imaginary parts:
THEOREM 2 Real and Imaginary Parts
A series (3) with z (cid:6)x (cid:7)iy converges and has the sum s(cid:6)u(cid:7)iv if and
m m m
only if x (cid:7)x (cid:7) Á converges and has the sum u and y (cid:7)y (cid:7) Á converges
1 2 1 2
and has the sum v.
Tests for Convergence and Divergence of Series
Convergence tests in complex are practically the same as in calculus. We apply them
before we use a series, to make sure that the series converges.
Divergence can often be shown very simply as follows.
THEOREM 3 Divergence
If a series z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á converges, then lim z (cid:6)0.Hence if this does not hold,
1 2 m:(cid:5) m
the series diverges.
PROOF If z
1
(cid:7)z
2
(cid:7) Á converges, with the sum s, then, since z m(cid:6)s m(cid:3)s m(cid:3)1,
lim z (cid:6) lim(s (cid:3)s )(cid:6) lim s (cid:3) lim s (cid:6)s(cid:3)s(cid:6)0. (cid:2)
m:(cid:5) m m:(cid:5) m m(cid:3)1 m:(cid:5) m m:(cid:5) m(cid:3)1
CAUTION! z :0is necessaryfor convergence but not sufficient, as we see from the
harmonic series
m
1(cid:7) 1 (cid:7)1 (cid:7)1 (cid:7) Á , which satisfies this condition but diverges, as is
2 3 4
shown in calculus (see, for example, Ref. [GenRef11] in App. 1).
The practical difficulty in proving convergence is that, in most cases, the sum of a series
is unknown. Cauchy overcame this by showing that a series converges if and only if its
partial sums eventually get close to each other:
THEOREM 4 Cauchy’s Convergence Principle for Series
A series z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á is convergent if and only if for every given P(cid:2)0(no matter
1 2
how small) we can find an N (which depends on P, in general) such that
(5) ƒz (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á (cid:7)z ƒ (cid:4)P for every n(cid:2)N and p(cid:6)1, 2, Á
n(cid:7)1 n(cid:7)2 n(cid:7)p
The somewhat involved proof is left optional (see App. 4).
Absolute Convergence. A series z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á is called absolutely convergentif the
1 2
series of the absolute values of the terms
(cid:2)

SEC. 15.1 Sequences, Series, Convergence Tests 675
If z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á converges but ƒz ƒ (cid:7) ƒz ƒ (cid:7) Á diverges, then the series z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á
1 2 1 2 1 2
is called, more precisely, conditionally convergent.
EXAMPLE 3 A Conditionally Convergent Series
The series 1(cid:3)1 (cid:7)1 (cid:3)1 (cid:7)(cid:3)Á converges, but only conditionally since the harmonic series diverges, as
2 3 4 (cid:2)
mentioned above (after Theorem 3).
If a series is absolutely convergent, it is convergent.
This follows readily from Cauchy’s principle (see Prob. 29). This principle also yields
the following general convergence test.
THEOREM 5 Comparison Test
If a series z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á is given and we can find a convergent series b (cid:7)b (cid:7) Á
1 2 1 2
with nonnegative real terms such that ƒz ƒ (cid:9)b , ƒz ƒ (cid:9)b ,Á ,then the given series
1 1 2 2
converges, even absolutely.
PROOF By Cauchy’s principle, since b (cid:7)b (cid:7) Á converges, for any given P(cid:2)0we can find
1 2
an N such that
b (cid:7) Á (cid:7)b (cid:4)P for every n(cid:2)N and p(cid:6)1, 2,Á .
n(cid:7)1 n(cid:7)p
From this and ƒz ƒ (cid:9)b , ƒz ƒ (cid:9)b ,Á we conclude that for those n and p,
1 1 2 2
ƒz ƒ (cid:7) Á (cid:7) ƒz ƒ (cid:9)b (cid:7) Á (cid:7)b (cid:4)P.
n(cid:7)1 n(cid:7)p n(cid:7)1 n(cid:7)p
Hence, again by Cauchy’s principle, ƒz ƒ (cid:7) ƒz ƒ (cid:7) Á converges, so that z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á is
1 2 1 2
absolutely convergent. (cid:2)
A good comparison series is the geometric series, which behaves as follows.
THEOREM 6 Geometric Series
The geometric series
(cid:2)
(6*) a qm(cid:6)1(cid:7)q(cid:7)q2(cid:7) Á

converges with the sum 1 (1 (cid:3)q) if ƒqƒ (cid:4)1 and diverges if ƒqƒ (cid:8)1.
>
PROOF If ƒqƒ (cid:8)1, then ƒqmƒ (cid:8)1 and Theorem 3 implies divergence.
Now let ƒqƒ (cid:4)1. The nth partial sum is
s (cid:6)1(cid:7)q(cid:7) Á (cid:7)qn.

From this,
qs (cid:6) q(cid:7) Á (cid:7)qn(cid:7)qn(cid:7)1.

n 1(cid:3)q 1(cid:3)q 1(cid:3)q
Since ƒqƒ (cid:4)1, the last term approaches zero as n:(cid:5). Hence if ƒqƒ (cid:4)1, the series is
convergent and has the sum 1 (1 (cid:3)q). This completes the proof. (cid:2)

Ratio Test
This is the most important test in our further work. We get it by taking the geometric
series as comparison series b (cid:7)b (cid:7) Á in Theorem 5:
1 2
THEOREM 7 Ratio Test

PROOF If (8) holds, then ƒz n(cid:7)1ƒ (cid:8) ƒz nƒ for n(cid:2)N,so that divergence of the series follows from

If the sequence of the ratios in (7) and (8) converges, we get the more convenient
THEOREM 8 Ratio Test
z
If a series z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á with z (cid:10)0 (n(cid:6)1, 2,Á )is such that lim n(cid:7)1 (cid:6)L,
then: 1 2 n n:(cid:5) ` z n `
(a) If L(cid:4)1, the series converges absolutely.
(b) If L(cid:2)1, the series diverges.
(c) If L(cid:6)1, the series may converge or diverge, so that the test fails and
permits no conclusion.
PROOF (a)We write k n(cid:6) ƒz n(cid:7)1>z nƒ and let L(cid:6)1(cid:3)b(cid:4)1.Then by the definition of limit, the
k must eventually get close to 1(cid:3)b, say, k (cid:9)q(cid:6)1(cid:3)1b(cid:4)1 for all n greater than
son me N. Convergence of z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á now fn ollows from T2 h eorem 7.
1 2
(b) Similarly, for L(cid:6)1(cid:7)c(cid:2)1we have k (cid:8)1(cid:7)1c(cid:2)1for all n(cid:2)N*(sufficiently
large), which implies divergence of z (cid:7)z n (cid:7) Á by 2 T heorem 7.
1 2
(c) The harmonic series 1(cid:7)1 (cid:7)1 (cid:7) Á has z z (cid:6)n (n(cid:7)1), hence L(cid:6)1, and
2 3 n(cid:7)1> n >
diverges. The series

Root Test
The ratio test and the root test are the two practically most important tests. The ratio test
is usually simpler, but the root test is somewhat more general.

n
the series diverges.
PROOF If (9) holds, then ƒz ƒ (cid:9)qn(cid:4)1 for all n(cid:2)N. Hence the series ƒz ƒ (cid:7) ƒz ƒ (cid:7) Á

converges by comparison with the geometric series, so that the series z (cid:7)z (cid:7) Á

Power Series
The student should pay close attention to the material because we shall show how power
series play an important role in complex analysis. Indeed, they are the most important series
in complex analysis because their sums are analytic functions (Theorem 5, Sec. 15.3), and
every analytic function can be represented by power series (Theorem 1, Sec. 15.4).
A power series in powers of z(cid:3)z is a series of the form
0
(cid:2)
(1) a a n(z (cid:3)z 0)n (cid:6)a 0(cid:7)a 1(z (cid:3)z 0)(cid:7)a 2(z (cid:3)z 0)2(cid:7) Á

where z is a complex variable, a , a , are complex (or real) constants, called the
0 1
coefficients of the series, and z is a complex (or real) constant, called the center of the
0
series. This generalizes real power series of calculus.
If z (cid:6)0, we obtain as a particular case a power series in powers of z:

Convergence Behavior of Power Series
Power series have variable terms (functions of z), but if we fix z, then all the concepts
for series with constant terms in the last section apply. Usually a series with variable
terms will converge for some zand diverge for others. For a power series the situation is
simple. The series (1) may converge in a disk with center z or in the whole z-plane or
0
only at z . We illustrate this with typical examples and then prove it.

Radius of Convergence of a Power Series
Convergence for every z (the nicest case, Example 2) or for no z(cid:10)z (the useless case,

Example 3) needs no further discussion, and we put these cases aside for a moment. We
consider the smallest circle with center z that includes all the points at which a given
0
power series (1) converges. Let R denote its radius. The circle
ƒz(cid:3)z ƒ (cid:6)R (Fig. 366)

is called the circle of convergenceand its radius Rthe radius of convergenceof (1). Theorem
1 then implies convergence everywhere within that circle, that is, for all zfor which

No general statements can be made about the convergence of a power series (1) on the

the idea.

Summary. Power series converge in an open circular disk or some even for every z(or
some only at the center, but they are useless); for the radius of convergence, see (6) or
Example 6.
Except for the useless ones, power series have sums that are analytic functions (as we
show in the next section); this accounts for their importance in complex analysis.

Functions Given by Power Series
Here, our main goal is to show that power series represent analytic functions. This fact
(Theorem 5) and the fact that power series behave nicely under addition, multiplication,
differentiation, and integration accounts for their usefulness.
To simplify the formulas in this section, we take z (cid:6)0 and write
0
(cid:2)
(1) a a nzn.
n(cid:6)0
There is no loss of generality because a series in powers of zˆ(cid:3)z with any z can always
0 0
be reduced to the form (1) if we set zˆ (cid:3)z (cid:6)z.
0
Terminology and Notation. If any given power series (1) has a nonzero radius of
convergence R (thus R(cid:2)0), its sum is a function of z, say f(z). Then we write
(cid:2)
(2) f (z)(cid:6) a a nzn (cid:6)a 0(cid:7)a 1z(cid:7)a 2z2(cid:7) Á (ƒzƒ (cid:4)R).
n(cid:6)0
We say that f(z) is represented by the power series or that it is developed in the power
series. For instance, the geometric series represents the function f(z)(cid:6)1 (1 (cid:3)z) in the
>
interior of the unit circle ƒzƒ (cid:6)1. (See Theorem 6 in Sec. 15.1.)
Uniqueness of a Power Series Representation. This is our next goal. It means that a
function f(z) cannot be represented by two different power series with the same center.
We claim that if f(z) can at all be developed in a power series with center z , the
0
development is unique. This important fact is frequently used in complex analysis (as well
as in calculus). We shall prove it in Theorem 2. The proof will follow from
THEOREM 1 Continuity of the Sum of a Power Series
If a function f(z)can be represented by a power series (2)with radius of convergence
R(cid:2)0, then f(z) is continuous at z (cid:6)0.
c15.qxd 11/1/10 6:41 PM Page 686
686 CHAP. 15 Power Series, Taylor Series
PROOF From (2) with z(cid:6)0 we have f(0) (cid:6)a . Hence by the definition of continuity we
0
must show that lim f(z)(cid:6)f(0) (cid:6)a . That is, we must show that for a given P(cid:2)0
z:0 0
there is a d(cid:2)0 such that ƒzƒ (cid:4)d implies ƒf(z)(cid:3)a ƒ (cid:4)P. Now (2) converges abso-

assuming z (cid:6)0 without loss of generality):

THEOREM 2 Identity Theorem for Power Series. Uniqueness

0 1 2 0 1 2
convergent for ƒzƒ (cid:4)R, where R is positive, and let them both have the same sum
for all these z. Then the series are identical, that is, a (cid:6)b , a (cid:6)b , a (cid:6)b ,Á .

The sums of these two power series are continuous at z(cid:6)0,by Theorem 1. Hence if we
consider ƒzƒ (cid:2)0 and let z:0 on both sides, we see that a (cid:6)b : the assertion is true
0 0
for n(cid:6)0. Now assume that a (cid:6)b for n(cid:6)0, 1,Á , m. Then on both sides we may
n n
omit the terms that are equal and divide the result by zm(cid:7)1 ((cid:10)0); this gives

m(cid:7)1 m(cid:7)2 m(cid:7)3 m(cid:7)1 m(cid:7)2 m(cid:7)3
Similarly as before by letting z: 0 we conclude from this that a (cid:6)b . This

Power Series Represent Analytic Functions
THEOREM 5 Analytic Functions. Their Derivatives
A power series with a nonzero radius of convergence R represents an analytic
function at every point interior to its circle of convergence. The derivatives of this
function are obtained by differentiating the original series term by term. All the
series thus obtained have the same radius of convergence as the original series.
Hence, by the first statement, each of them represents an analytic function.
PROOF (a) We consider any power series (1) with positive radius of convergence R. Let f(z) be
its sum and f (z) the sum of its derived series; thus

(4) f (z)(cid:6) a a nzn and f 1(z)(cid:6) a na nzn(cid:3)1.
n(cid:6)0 n(cid:6)1
We show that f(z) is analytic and has the derivative f (z) in the interior of the circle of
1
convergence. We do this by proving that for any fixed z with ƒzƒ (cid:4)R and ¢z:0 the
difference quotient [ f(z (cid:7) ¢z) (cid:3)f(z)] ¢zapproaches f (z).By termwise addition we first
> 1
have from (4)
f(z(cid:7) ¢z) (cid:3)f(z) (cid:2) (z (cid:7) ¢z)n (cid:3)zn
(5) ¢z (cid:3)f 1(z)(cid:6) a a n c ¢z (cid:3)nzn(cid:3)1 d .
n(cid:6)2
Note that the summation starts with 2, since the constant term drops out in taking the
difference f(z(cid:7) ¢z) (cid:3)f(z),and so does the linear term when we subtract f (z)from the
1
difference quotient.

n(cid:2)1.Since (n(cid:2)1)2(cid:9)n(n(cid:2)1),we see that for ƒzƒ (cid:9)R and ƒz(cid:6) ¢zƒ (cid:9)R , R (cid:3)R,

Letting ¢z:0 and noting that R ((cid:3) R) is arbitrary, we conclude that f(z) is analytic at

any point interior to the circle of convergence and its derivative is represented by the derived
series. From this the statements about the higher derivatives follow by induction. (cid:2)
Summary. The results in this section show that power series are about as nice as we
could hope for: we can differentiate and integrate them term by term (Theorems 3 and 4).
Theorem 5 accounts for the great importance of power series in complex analysis: the
sum of such a series (with a positive radius of convergence) is an analytic function and
has derivatives of all orders, which thus in turn are analytic functions. But this is only
part of the story. In the next section we show that, conversely, everygiven analytic function
f(z)can be represented by power series, called Taylor seriesand being the complex analog
of the real Taylor series of calculus.

We see that Taylor series are power series. From the last section we know that power
series represent analytic functions. And we now show that everyanalytic function can be
represented by power series, namely, by Taylor series (with various centers). This makes
Taylor series very important in complex analysis. Indeed, they are more fundamental in
complex analysis than their real counterparts are in calculus.
THEOREM 1 Taylor’s Theorem
Let f(z) be analytic in a domain D, and let z(cid:6)z be any point in D. Then there

We prove (9) as follows. Since z* lies on C, whereas z lies inside C (Fig. 367), we have
ƒz*(cid:3)zƒ (cid:2)0.Since f(z)is analytic inside and on C, it is bounded, and so is the function

Uniqueness follows from Theorem 2 in the last section. Finally, (5) follows from a in

(1) and the Cauchy inequality in Sec. 14.4. This proves Taylor’s theorem. (cid:2)
Accuracy of Approximation. We can achieve any preassinged accuracy in approxi-
mating f(z) by a partial sum of (1) by choosing n large enough. This is the practical use
of formula (9).
Singularity, Radius of Convergence. On the circle of convergence of (1) there is at
least one singular point of f(z), that is, a point z(cid:6)c at which f(z) is not analytic
(but such that every disk with center c contains points at which f(z) is analytic). We
also say that f(z) is singular at c or has a singularity at c. Hence the radius of con-
vergence R of (1) is usually equal to the distance from z to the nearest singular point
0
of f(z).
(Sometimes R can be greater than that distance: Ln z is singular on the negative real
axis, whose distance from z (cid:6)(cid:3)1(cid:7)i is 1, but the Taylor series of Ln z with center
0
z (cid:6)(cid:3)1(cid:7)i has radius of convergence 12.)

Comparison with Real Functions. One surprising property of complex analytic
functions is that they have derivatives of all orders, and now we have discovered the other
surprising property that they can always be represented by power series of the form (1).
This is not true in general for real functions;there are real functions that have derivatives
of all orders but cannot be represented by a power series. (Example: f(x)(cid:6)exp ((cid:3)1 x2)
>
if x(cid:10)0 and f(0) (cid:6)0; this function cannot be represented by a Maclaurin series in an
open disk with center 0 because all its derivatives at 0 are zero.)
Important Special Taylor Series
These are as in calculus, with x replaced by complex z. Can you see why? (Answer. The
coefficient formulas are the same.)
EXAMPLE 1 Geometric Series
Let f(z)(cid:6)1 (1(cid:3)z).Then we have f(n)(z)(cid:6)n! (1(cid:3)z)n(cid:7)1, f(n)(0)(cid:6)n!.Hence the Maclaurin expansion of

f(z)is singular at z(cid:6)1;this point lies on the circle of convergence. (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 2 Exponential Function

n(cid:6)0
This series is also obtained if we replace xin the familiar Maclaurin series of exby z.
Furthermore, by setting z(cid:6)iyin (12) and separating the series into the real and imaginary parts (see Theorem
2, Sec. 15.1) we obtain
(cid:2) (iy)n (cid:2) y2k (cid:2) y2k(cid:7)1
eiy(cid:6) a n! (cid:6) a ((cid:3)1)k (2k)!(cid:7)ia ((cid:3)1)k (2k(cid:7)1)! .
n(cid:6)0 k(cid:6)0 k(cid:6)0
Since the series on the right are the familiar Maclaurin series of the real functions cos yand sin y,this shows
that we have rediscovered the Euler formula
(13) eiy(cid:6)cos y(cid:7)i sin y.
Indeed, one may use (12) for defining ez and derive from (12) the basic properties of ez. For instance, the
differentiation formula
(ez)r(cid:6)ezfollows
readily from (12) by termwise differentiation.

Uniform Convergence. Optional
We know that power series are absolutely convergent (Sec. 15.2, Theorem 1) and, as
another basic property, we now show that they are uniformly convergent. Since uniform
convergence is of general importance, for instance, in connection with termwise integration
of series, we shall discuss it quite thoroughly.
To define uniform convergence, we consider a series whose terms are any complex
Á
functions f (z), f (z),
0 1
(cid:2)
(1) a f m(z)(cid:6)f 0(z)(cid:7)f 1(z)(cid:7)f 2(z)(cid:7) Á .
m(cid:6)0
(This includes power series as a special case in which f (z)(cid:6)a (z (cid:3)z )m.)We assume
m m 0
that the series (1) converges for all z in some region G. We call its sum s(z) and its nth
partial sum s (z); thus
n
s (z)(cid:6)f (z)(cid:7)f (z)(cid:7) Á (cid:7)f (z).
n 0 1 n
Convergence in Gmeans the following. If we pick a z(cid:6)z in G, then, by the definition
1
of convergence at z , for given P(cid:2)0 we can find an N (P) such that
1 1
ƒs(z )(cid:3)s (z )ƒ (cid:4)P for all n(cid:2)N (P).
1 n 1 1
If we pick a z in G, keeping P as before, we can find an N (P) such that
2 2
ƒs(z )(cid:3)s (z )ƒ (cid:4)P for all n(cid:2)N (P),
2 n 2 2
and so on. Hence, given an P(cid:2)0,to each zin Gthere corresponds a number N (P).This
z
number tells us how many terms we need (what s we need) at a zto make ƒs(z)(cid:3)s (z)ƒ
n n
smaller than P. Thus this number N (P) measures the speed of convergence.
z
Small N (P)means rapid convergence, large N (P)means slow convergence at the point
z z
z considered. Now, if we can find an N(P) larger than all these N (P) for all z in G, we
z
say that the convergence of the series (1) in G is uniform. Hence this basic concept is
defined as follows.
DEFINITION Uniform Convergence
A series (1) with sum s(z)is called uniformly convergentin a region Gif for every
P(cid:2)0 we can find an N(cid:6)N(P), not depending on z, such that
ƒs(z)(cid:3)s (z)ƒ (cid:4)P for all n(cid:2)N(P) and all z in G.
n
Uniformity of convergence is thus a property that always refers to an infinite setin
the z-plane, that is, a set consisting of infinitely many points.
EXAMPLE 1 Geometric Series
Show that the geometric series 1(cid:7)z(cid:7)z2(cid:7)Á is (a) uniformly convergent in any closed disk ƒzƒ (cid:9)r(cid:4)1,
(b) not uniformly convergent in its whole disk of convergence ƒzƒ (cid:4)1.

Solution. (a) For z in that closed disk we have ƒ1(cid:3)zƒ (cid:8)1(cid:3)r (sketch it). This implies that

Since r(cid:4)1,we can make the right side as small as we want by choosing nlarge enough, and since the right
side does not depend on z(in the closed disk c2onsidered), 2this2 means 2that the convergence is uniform.
(b) For given real K(no matter how large) and nwe can always find a zin the disk ƒzƒ (cid:4)1such that

simply by taking zclose enough to 1. Hence no single N(P)will suffice to make ƒs(z)(cid:3)s (z)ƒ smaller than a
n
given P(cid:2)0throughout the whole disk.By definition, this shows that the convergence of the geometric series
in ƒzƒ (cid:4)1 is not uniform. (cid:2)
This example suggests that for a power series, the uniformity of convergence may at most
be disturbed near the circle of convergence. This is true:
THEOREM 1 Uniform Convergence of Power Series
A power series

(2) a a m(z (cid:3)z 0)m

Now (2) converges absolutely if ƒz(cid:3)z ƒ (cid:6)r(cid:4)R (by Theorem 1 in Sec. 15.2). Hence
0
it follows from the Cauchy convergence principle (Sec. 15.1) that, an P(cid:2)0being given,
we can find an N(P) such that
ƒa ƒrn(cid:7)1(cid:7) Á (cid:7) ƒa ƒrn(cid:7)p(cid:4)P for n(cid:2)N(P) and p(cid:6)1, 2,Á .
n(cid:7)1 n(cid:7)p
From this and (3) we obtain
ƒa (z (cid:3)z )n(cid:7)1(cid:7) Á (cid:7)a (z (cid:3)z )n(cid:7)pƒ (cid:4)P

for all zin the disk ƒz(cid:3)z ƒ (cid:9)r,every n(cid:2)N(P),and every p(cid:6)1, 2,Á .Since N(P)is
0
independent of z, this shows uniform convergence, and the theorem is proved. (cid:2)
Thus we have established uniform convergence of power series, the basic concern of this
section. We now shift from power series to arbitary series of variable termsand examine
uniform convergence in this more general setting. This will give a deeper understanding
of uniform convergence.

Properties of Uniformly Convergent Series
Uniform convergence derives its main importance from two facts:
1. If a series of continuous terms is uniformly convergent, its sum is also continuous
(Theorem 2, below).
2. Under the same assumptions, termwise integration is permissible (Theorem 3).
This raises two questions:
1. How can a converging series of continuous terms manage to have a discontinuous
sum? (Example 2)
2. How can something go wrong in termwise integration? (Example 3)
Another natural question is:
3. What is the relation between absolute convergence and uniform convergence? The
surprising answer: none. (Example 5)
These are the ideas we shall discuss.
If we add finitely manycontinuous functions, we get a continuous function as their sum.
Example 2 will show that this is no longer true for an infinite series, even if it converges
absolutely. However, if it converges uniformly, this cannot happen, as follows.
THEOREM 2 Continuity of the Sum
Let the series
(cid:2)
a f m(z)(cid:6)f 0(z)(cid:7)f 1(z)(cid:7) Á
m(cid:6)0
be uniformly convergent in a region G. Let F(z)be its sum. Then if each term f (z)
m
is continuous at a point z in G, the function F(z) is continuous at z .
1 1
PROOF Let s (z) be the nth partial sum of the series and R (z) the corresponding remainder:
n n
s (cid:6)f (cid:7)f (cid:7) Á (cid:7)f , R (cid:6)f (cid:7)f (cid:7) Á .
n 0 1 n n n(cid:7)1 n(cid:7)2
Since the series converges uniformly, for a given P(cid:2)0we can find an N(cid:6)N(P)such that
P
ƒR (z)ƒ (cid:4) for all z in G.
N 3
Since s (z) is a sum of finitely many functions that are continuous at z , this sum is
N 1
continuous at z . Therefore, we can find a d(cid:2)0 such that
1
P
ƒs (z)(cid:3)s (z )ƒ (cid:4) for all z in G for which ƒz(cid:3) z ƒ (cid:4)d.
N N 1 3 1
Using F(cid:6)s (cid:7)R and the triangle inequality (Sec. 13.2), for these z we thus obtain

This implies that F(z) is continuous at z , and the theorem is proved. (cid:2)

1(cid:7)x2 (1(cid:7)x2)2 (1(cid:7)x2)3
This is a geometric series with q(cid:6)1 (1(cid:7)x2)times a factor x2. Its nth partial sum is

n c 1(cid:7)x2 (1(cid:7)x2)2 (1(cid:7)x2)n d
We now use the trick by which one finds the sum of a geometric series, namely, we multiply s (x) by
n

(cid:3) 1 s (x)(cid:6)(cid:3)x2 1 (cid:7)Á(cid:7) 1 (cid:7) 1 .
1(cid:7)x2 n c1(cid:7)x2 (1(cid:7)x2)n (1(cid:7)x2)n(cid:7)1 d
Adding this to the previous formula, simplifying on the left, and canceling most terms on the right, we obtain
x2 1
s (x)(cid:6)x2 1(cid:3) ,
1(cid:7)x2 n c (1(cid:7)x2)n(cid:7)1 d
thus
1
s (x)(cid:6)1(cid:7)x2(cid:3) .
n (1(cid:7)x2)n
The exciting Fig. 368 “explains” what is going on. We see that if x(cid:10)0, the sum is
s(x)(cid:6) lim s (x)(cid:6)1(cid:7)x2,
n:(cid:5) n
but for x(cid:6)0we have s (0)(cid:6)1(cid:3)1(cid:6)0for all n, hence s(0)(cid:6)0.So we have the surprising fact that the sum
n
is discontinuous (at x(cid:6)0),although all the terms are continuous and the series converges even absolutely (its
terms are nonnegative, thus equal to their absolute value!).
Theorem 2 now tells us that the convergence cannot be uniform in an interval containing x(cid:6)0.We can also
verify this directly. Indeed, for x(cid:10)0the remainder has the absolute value
1
ƒR (x)ƒ (cid:6) ƒs(x)(cid:3)s (x)ƒ (cid:6)
n n (1(cid:7)x2)n
and we see that for a given P ((cid:4)1)we cannot find an Ndepending only on Psuch that ƒR ƒ (cid:4)Pfor all n(cid:2)N(P)

Termwise Integration
This is our second topic in connection with uniform convergence, and we begin with an
example to become aware of the danger of just blindly integrating term-by-term.

EXAMPLE 3 Series for Which Termwise Integration Is Not Permissible
Let u (x)(cid:6)mxe(cid:3)mx2and consider the series

a f m(x) where f m(x)(cid:6)u m(x)(cid:3)u m(cid:3)1(x)

Hence the series has the sum F(x)(cid:6) lim s (x)(cid:6) lim u (x)(cid:6)0 (0(cid:9)x(cid:9)1). From this we obtain
n:(cid:5) n n:(cid:5) n

F(x) dx(cid:6)0.

On the other hand, by integrating term by term and using f (cid:7)f (cid:7)Á (cid:7)f (cid:6)s ,we have

but not 0. This shows that the series under consideration cannot be integrated term by term from x(cid:6)0to
x(cid:6)1. (cid:2)
The series in Example 3 is not uniformly convergent in the interval of integration, and
we shall now prove that in the case of a uniformly convergent series of continuous
functions we may integrate term by term.

Hence, the series (4) converges and has the sum indicated in the theorem. (cid:2)
Theorems 2 and 3 characterize the two most important properties of uniformly convergent
series. Also, since differentiation and integration are inverse processes, Theorem 3 implies

Test for Uniform Convergence
Uniform convergence is usually proved by the following comparison test.
THEOREM 5 Weierstrass5M-Test for Uniform Convergence
Consider a series of the form (1)in a region G of the z-plane. Suppose that one can
find a convergent series of constant terms,

such that ƒf (z)ƒ (cid:9)M for all z in G and every m(cid:6)0, 1,Á .Then (1)is uniformly

convergent in G.
The simple proof is left to the student (Team Project 18).
5KARL WEIERSTRASS (1815–1897), great German mathematician, who developed complex analysis based
on the concept of power series and residue integration. (See footnote in Section 13.4.) He put analysis on a
sound theoretical footing. His mathematical rigor is so legendary that one speaks Weierstrassian rigor. (See
paper by Birkhoff and Kreyszig, 1984 in footnote in Sec. 5.5; Kreyszig, E., On the Calculus, of Variations and
Its Major Influences on the Mathematics of the First Half of Our Century. Part II, American Mathematical
Monthly(1994), 101, No. 9, pp. 902–908). Weierstrass also made contributions to the calculus of variations,
approximation theory, and differential geometry. He obtained the concept of uniform convergence in 1841
(published 1894, sic!); the first publication on the concept was by G. G. STOKES (see Sec 10.9) in 1847.

No Relation Between Absolute
and Uniform Convergence
We finally show the surprising fact that there are series that converge absolutely but not
uniformly, and others that converge uniformly but not absolutely, so that there is no relation

The series in Example 2 converges absolutely but not uniformly, as we have shown. On the other hand, the series
a(cid:2) ((cid:3)1)m(cid:3)1 (cid:6) 1 (cid:3) 1 (cid:7) 1 (cid:3) (cid:7)Á (xreal)
m(cid:6)1
x2(cid:7)m x2(cid:7)1 x2(cid:7)2 x2(cid:7)3
converges uniformly on the whole real line but not absolutely.
Proof.By the familiar Leibniz test of calculus (see App. A3.3) the remainder R does not exceed its first
n
term in absolute value, since we have a series of alternating terms whose absolute values form a monotone
decreasing sequence with limit zero. Hence given P(cid:2)0,for all xwe have

ƒR (x)ƒ (cid:9) (cid:4) (cid:4)P if n(cid:2)N(P)(cid:8) .
n x2(cid:7)n(cid:7)1 n P
This proves uniform convergence, since N(P)does not depend on x.
The convergence is not absolute because for any fixedxwe have

for all z(then we write R(cid:6) (cid:5)).In exceptional cases a power series may converge
only at the center; such a series is practically useless. Also, R(cid:6)lim ƒa a ƒ
n> n(cid:7)1
if this limit exists. The series (1) converges absolutely (Sec. 15.2) and uniformly
(Sec. 15.5) in every closed disk ƒz(cid:3)z ƒ (cid:9)r(cid:4)R (R(cid:2)0).It represents an analytic

function f(z) for ƒz(cid:3)z ƒ (cid:4)R. The derivatives fr (z), fs (z),Á are obtained by
0
termwise differentiation of (1), and these series have the same radius of convergence
R as (1). See Sec. 15.3.
Conversely, everyanalytic function f(z)can be represented by power series. These

generally equal to the distance from z to the nearest singularity of f(z) (point at

which f(z) ceases to be analytic as defined in Sec. 15.4). If f(z) is entire (analytic
for all z; see Sec. 13.5), then (2) converges for all z. The functions ez, cos z, sin z,
etc. have Maclaurin series, that is, Taylor series with center 0, similar to those in
calculus (Sec. 15.4).

Laurent Series.
Residue Integration
The main purpose of this chapter is to learn about another powerful method for evaluating
complex integrals and certain real integrals. It is called residue integration. Recall that
the first method of evaluating complex integrals consisted of directly applying Cauchy’s
integral formula of Sec. 14.3. Then we learned about Taylor series (Chap. 15) and will
now generalize Taylor series. The beauty of residue integration, the second method of
integration, is that it brings together a lot of the previous material.
Laurent series generalize Taylor series. Indeed, whereas a Taylor series has positive
integer powers (and a constant term) and converges in a disk, a Laurent series(Sec. 16.1)
is a series of positive and negativeinteger powers of z(cid:2)z and converges in an annulus
0
(a circular ring) with center z . Hence, by a Laurent series, we can represent a given
0
function f(z) that is analytic in an annulus and may have singularities outside the ring as
well as in the “hole” of the annulus.
We know that for a given function the Taylor series with a given center z is unique.
0
We shall see that, in contrast, a function f(z) can have several Laurent series with the
same center z and valid in several concentric annuli. The most important of these series
0
is the one that converges for 0(cid:3) ƒz(cid:2)z ƒ (cid:3)R, that is, everywhere near the center z
0 0
except at z itself, where z is a singular point of f(z). The series (or finite sum) of the
0 0
negative powers of this Laurent series is called the principal part of the singularity of
f(z)at z ,and is used to classify this singularity (Sec. 16.2). The coefficient of the power
0
1 (z(cid:2)z )of thisseries is called the residueof f(z)at z .Residues are used in an elegant
> 0 0
and powerful integration method, called residue integration, for complex contour integrals
(Sec. 16.3) as well as for certain complicated real integrals (Sec. 16.4).

Laurent Series
Laurent series generalize Taylor series. If, in an application, we want to develop a function
f(z) in powers of z(cid:2)z when f(z) is singular at z (as defined in Sec. 15.4), we cannot

use a Taylor series. Instead we can use a new kind of series, called Laurent series,1

Laurent series are also used for classifying singularities (Sec. 16.2) and in a powerful
integration method (“residue integration,” Sec. 16.3).
A Laurent series of f(z)converges in an annulus (in the “hole” of which f(z)may have
singularities), as follows.
THEOREM 1 Laurent’s Theorem
Let f(z) be analytic in a domain containing two concentric circles C and C with
1 2
center z and the annulus between them (blue in Fig. 370). Then f(z) can be

taken counterclockwise around any simple closed path C that lies in the annulus
and encircles the inner circle, as in Fig. 370. [The variable of integration is denoted
by z* since z is used in (1).]
This series converges and represents f(z)in the enlarged open annulus obtained
from the given annulus by continuously increasing the outer circle C and decreasing
1
C until each of the two circles reaches a point where f(z) is singular.
2
In the important special case that z is the only singular point of f(z) inside C ,
0 2
this circle can be shrunk to the point z ,giving convergence in a disk except at the
0
center. In this case the series (or finite sum) of the negative powers of (1)is called
the principal part of f(z) at z [or of that Laurent series (1)].

Let us now prove Laurent’s theorem.
PROOF (a) The nonnegative powers are those of a Taylor series.
To see this, we use Cauchy’s integral formula (3) in Sec. 14.3 with z* (instead of z) as
the variable of integration and z instead of z . Let g(z) and h(z) denote the functions
0
represented by the two terms in (3), Sec. 14.3. Then

Here zis any point in the given annulus and we integrate counterclockwise over both C

and C , so that the minus sign appears since in (3) of Sec. 14.3 the integration over C
2 2
is taken clockwise. We transform each of these two integrals as in Sec. 15.4. The first
integral is precisely as in Sec. 15.4. Hence we get exactly the same result, namely, the

it lies in the exterior of the path C . Hence the situation differs from that for the first

integral. The essential point is that instead of [see (7*) in Sec. 15.4]

because f(z*) is analytic in the annulus and on C , and z* lies on C and z outside, so
2 2
that z(cid:2)z* (cid:7)0. From this and the ML-inequality (Sec. 14.1) applied to (7) we get the

From (6b) we see that the expression on the right approaches zero as napproaches infinity.
This proves (8). The representation (1) with coefficients (2) is now established in the given
annulus.
(d) Convergence of (1) in the enlarged annulus. The first series in (1) is a Taylor
series [representing g(z)]; hence it converges in the disk D with center z whose radius

equals the distance of the singularity (or singularities) closest to z . Also, g(z) must be

singular at all points outside C where f(z) is singular.

The second series in (1), representing h(z),is a power series in Z(cid:4)1 (z (cid:2)z ).Let the

Uniqueness. The Laurent series of a given analytic function f(z) in its annulus of
convergence is unique (see Team Project 18). However, f(z) may have different Laurent
series in two annuli with the same center; see the examples below. The uniqueness is
essential. As for a Taylor series, to obtain the coefficients of Laurent series, we do not
generally use the integral formulas (2); instead, we use various other methods, some of
which we shall illustrate in our examples. If a Laurent series has been found by any such
process, the uniqueness guarantees that it must be theLaurent series of the given function
in the given annulus.

Singularities and Zeros. Infinity
Roughly, a singular point of an analytic function f(z) is a z at which f(z) ceases to be
0
analytic, and a zero is a z at which f(z)(cid:4)0. Precise definitions follow below. In this
section we show that Laurent series can be used for classifying singularities and Taylor
series for discussing zeros.
Singularities were defined in Sec. 15.4, as we shall now recall and extend. We also
remember that, by definition, a function is a single-valued relation, as was emphasized
in Sec. 13.3.
We say that a function f(z)is singularor has a singularityat a point z(cid:4)z if f(z)is not
0
analytic (perhaps not even defined) at z(cid:4)z , but every neighborhood of z(cid:4) z contains
0 0
points at which f(z)is analytic. We also say that z(cid:4)z is a singular pointof f(z).
0
We call z(cid:4)z an isolated singularity of f(z) if z(cid:4)z has a neighborhood without
0 0
further singularities of f(z). Example:tan zhas isolated singularities at (cid:6)p 2, (cid:6)3p 2,etc.;
> >
tan (1 z) has a nonisolated singularity at 0. (Explain!)

is, in a region of the form
0(cid:3) ƒz(cid:2)z ƒ (cid:3)R.
0
The sum of the first series is analytic at z(cid:4)z , as we know from the last section. The
0
second series, containing the negative powers, is called the principal part of (1), as we
remember from the last section. If it has only finitely many terms, it is of the form
b b

Then the singularity of f(z) at z(cid:4)z is called a pole, and mis called its order. Poles of
0
the first order are also known as simple poles.
If the principal part of (1) has infinitely many terms, we say that f(z) has at z(cid:4)z an
0
isolated essential singularity.
We leave aside nonisolated singularities.

Section 16.1 provides further examples. In that section, Example 1 shows that z(cid:2)5 sin zhas a fourth-order
pole at 0. Furthermore, Example 4 shows that 1 (z3(cid:2)z4)has a third-order pole at 0 and a Laurent series with
>
infinitely many negative powers. This is no contradiction, since this series is valid for ƒzƒ (cid:9)1;it merely tells
us that in classifying singularities it is quite important to consider the Laurent series valid in the immediate
(cid:2)
neighborhoodof a singular point. In Example 4 this is the series (I), which has three negative powers.
The classification of singularities into poles and essential singularities is not merely a formal
matter, because the behavior of an analytic function in a neighborhood of an essential
singularity is entirely different from that in the neighborhood of a pole.
EXAMPLE 2 Behavior Near a Pole
f(z)(cid:4)1 z2 has a pole at z(cid:4)0, and ƒf(z)ƒ : (cid:8) as z : 0 in any manner. This illustrates the following

theorem.

The proof is left as an exercise (see Prob. 24).
EXAMPLE 3 Behavior Near an Essential Singularity
The function f (z)(cid:4)e1 >zhas an essential singularity at z(cid:4)0.It has no limit for approach along the imaginary
axis; it becomes infinite if z:0through positive real values, but it approaches zero if z:0through negative real
values. It takes on any given value c(cid:4)c eia(cid:7)0in an arbitrarily small P-neighborhood of z(cid:4)0.To see the
0
latter, we set z(cid:4)reiu,and then obtain the following complex equation for rand u,which we must solve:
e1 >z(cid:4)e(cos u(cid:2)i sin u) >r(cid:4)c 0eia.
Equating the absolute values and the arguments, we have e(cos u) >r(cid:4)c 0,that is
cos u(cid:4)r ln c , and (cid:2)sin u(cid:4)ar
0
respectively. From these two equations and cos2 u(cid:5)sin2 u(cid:4)r2(ln c )2(cid:5)a2r2(cid:4)1we obtain the formulas

Hence rcan be made arbitrarily small by adding multiples of 2pto a,leaving cunaltered. This illustrates the
very famous Picard’s theorem(with z(cid:4)0as the exceptional value). (cid:2)

If f(z) is analytic and has an isolated essential singularity at a point z , it takes on
0
every value, with at most one exceptional value, in an arbitrarily small P-neighborhood
of z .

Removable Singularities. We say that a function f(z) has a removable singularity at
z(cid:4)z if f(z) is not analytic at z(cid:4)z , but can be made analytic there by assigning a
0 0
suitable value f(z ). Such singularities are of no interest since they can be removed as

just indicated. Example:f(z)(cid:4)(sin z) zbecomes analytic at z(cid:4)0if we define f(0) (cid:4)1.

has simple zeros at 0, (cid:6)p, (cid:6)2p,Á ,and sin2 zhas second-order zeros at these points. The function 1(cid:2)cos zhas
second-order zeros at 0, (cid:6)2p, (cid:6)4p,Á ,and the function (1(cid:2)cos z)2has fourth-order zeros at these points. (cid:2)

This is characteristic of such a zero, because, if f(z) has such a Taylor series, it has an
nth-order zero at z(cid:4)z , as follows by differentiation.

Whereas nonisolated singularities may occur, for zeros we have
THEOREM 3 Zeros
The zeros of an analytic function f(z) ([ 0) are isolated; that is, each of them has
a neighborhood that contains no further zeros of f(z).
PROOF The factor (z(cid:2)z )nin (3) is zero only at z(cid:4)z .The power series in the brackets [Á ]
0 0
represents an analytic function (by Theorem 5 in Sec. 15.3), call it g(z). Now
g(z )(cid:4)a (cid:7)0, since an analytic function is continuous, and because of this continuity,
0 n
also g(z)(cid:7)0 in some neighborhood of z(cid:4)z . Hence the same holds of f(z). (cid:2)
0
This theorem is illustrated by the functions in Example 4.
Poles are often caused by zeros in the denominator. (Example: tan z has poles where
cos zis zero.) This is a major reason for the importance of zeros. The key to the connection
is the following theorem, whose proof follows from (3) (see Team Project 12).

Riemann Sphere. Point at Infinity
When we want to study complex functions for large ƒzƒ, the complex plane will generally
become rather inconvenient. Then it may be better to use a representation of complex numbers
on the so-called Riemann sphere. This is a sphere S of diameter 1 touching the complex
z-plane at z(cid:4)0(Fig. 372), and we let the image of a point P(a number zin the plane) be
the intersection P* of the segment PN with S, where N is the “North Pole” diametrically
opposite to the origin in the plane. Then to each zthere corresponds a point on S.
Conversely, each point on Srepresents a complex number z, except for N, which does
not correspond to any point in the complex plane. This suggests that we introduce an
additional point, called the point at infinity and denoted (cid:8) (“infinity”) and let its image
be N. The complex plane together with (cid:8) is called the extended complex plane. The
complex plane is often called the finite complex plane, for distinction, or simply the
complex plane as before. The sphere S is called the Riemann sphere. The mapping of
the extended complex plane onto the sphere is known as a stereographic projection.
(What is the image of the Northern Hemisphere? Of the Western Hemisphere? Of a straight
line through the origin?)
Analytic or Singular at Infinity
If we want to investigate a function f(z)for large ƒzƒ,we may now set z(cid:4)1 wand investigate

(4) g(0) (cid:4) lim g(w)

if this limit exists.
Furthermore, we say that f(z)has an nth-order zero at infinityif f(1 w)has such a zero

at w(cid:4)0. Similarly for poles and essential singularities.
EXAMPLE 5 Functions Analytic or Singular at Infinity. Entire and Meromorphic Functions
The function f(z)(cid:4)1 z2is analytic at (cid:8)since g(w)(cid:4)f(1 w)(cid:4)w2is analytic at w(cid:4)0,and f(z)has a second-
> >
order zero at (cid:8). The function f(z)(cid:4)z3 is singular at (cid:8) and has a third-order pole there since the function
g(w)(cid:4)f (1 >w)(cid:4)1 >w3has such a pole at w(cid:4)0.The function ezhas an essential singularity at (cid:8) since e1 >w
has such a singularity at w(cid:4)0.Similarly, cos zand sin zhave an essential singularity at (cid:8).
Recall that an entire functionis one that is analytic everywhere in the (finite) complex plane. Liouville’s
theorem (Sec. 14.4) tells us that the only bounded entire functions are the constants, hence any nonconstant
entire function must be unbounded. Hence it has a singularity at (cid:8),a pole if it is a polynomial or an essential
singularity if it is not. The functions just considered are typical in this respect.

Residue Integration Method
We now cover a second method of evaluating complex integrals. Recall that we solved
complex integrals directly by Cauchy’s integral formula in Sec. 14.3. In Chapter 15 we
learned about power series and especially Taylor series. We generalized Taylor series to
Laurent series (Sec. 16.1) and investigated singularities and zeroes of various functions
(Sec. 16.2). Our hard work has paid off and we see how much of the theoretical groundwork
comes together in evaluating complex integrals by the residue method.
The purpose of Cauchy’s residue integration method is the evaluation of integrals
(cid:2)
f(z) dz
C
taken around a simple closed path C. The idea is as follows.
If f(z) is analytic everywhere on C and inside C, such an integral is zero by Cauchy’s
integral theorem (Sec. 14.2), and we are done.

720 CHAP. 16 Laurent Series. Residue Integration
The situation changes if f(z)has a singularity at a point z(cid:4)z inside Cbut is otherwise
0
analytic on C and inside C as before. Then f(z) has a Laurent series

0 0
form 0(cid:3) ƒz(cid:2)z ƒ (cid:3)R(sometimes called a deleted neighborhood, an old-fashioned term
0
that we shall not use). Now comes the key idea. The coefficient b of the first negative
1
power 1 (z(cid:2)z ) of this Laurent series is given by the integral formula (2) in Sec. 16.1
> 0
with n(cid:4)1, namely,
1 (cid:2)
b (cid:4) f(z) dz.

C
Now, since we can obtain Laurent series by various methods, without using the integral
formulas for the coefficients (see the examples in Sec. 16.1), we can find b by one of
1
those methods and then use the formula for b for evaluating the integral, that is,
1
(cid:2)
(1) f(z) dz (cid:4)2pib .

C
Here we integrate counterclockwise around a simple closed path C that contains z(cid:4)z
0
in its interior (but no other singular points of f(z) on or inside C!).
The coefficient b is called the residue of f(z) at z(cid:4)z and we denote it by
1 0

and the residue b (cid:4)(cid:2)1!. From (1) we thus obtain the answer

Hence it is of no interest here. So we need the residue of f(z) at 0. We find it from the Laurent series that
converges for 0(cid:3) ƒzƒ (cid:3)1.This is series (I) in Example 4, Sec. 16.1,

Formulas for Residues
To calculate a residue at a pole, we need not produce a whole Laurent series, but, more
economically, we can derive formulas for residues once and for all.
Simple Poles at z . A first formula for the residue at a simple pole is
0
(3) Res f(z)(cid:4)b (cid:4) lim (z (cid:2)z )f(z). (Proof below).
z(cid:4)z0 1 z:z0 0
A second formula for the residue at a simple pole is
p(z) p(z )
(4) Res f(z)(cid:4)Res (cid:4) 0 . (Proof below).
z(cid:4)z0 z(cid:4)z0 q(z) qr(z 0)
In (4) we assume that f(z)(cid:4)p(z) q(z) with p(z )(cid:7)0 and q(z) has a simple zero at z ,
> 0 0
so that f(z) has a simple pole at z by Theorem 4 in Sec. 16.2.

PROOF We prove (3). For a simple pole at z(cid:4)z the Laurent series (1), Sec. 16.1, is

Here b (cid:7)0.(Why?) Multiplying both sides by z(cid:2)z and then letting z : z ,we obtain
1 0 0
the formula (3):
lim (z (cid:2)z )f(z)(cid:4)b (cid:5) lim (z (cid:2)z )[a (cid:5)a (z (cid:2)z )(cid:5) Á ](cid:4)b
z:z0 0 1 z:z0 0 0 1 0 1
where the last equality follows from continuity (Theorem 1, Sec. 15.3).
We prove (4). The Taylor series of q(z) at a simple zero z is
0
(z (cid:2)z )2
q(z)(cid:4)(z (cid:2)z )qr (z )(cid:5) 0 qs (z )(cid:5) Á .

z(cid:2)z cancels. By continuity, the limit of the denominator is qr (z )and (4) follows. (cid:2)

Several Singularities Inside the Contour.
Residue Theorem
Residue integration can be extended from the case of a single singularity to the case of
several singularities within the contour C. This is the purpose of the residue theorem. The
extension is surprisingly simple.

We assume that the function f(x) in (4) is a real rational function whose denominator
is different from zero for all real x and is of degree at least two units higher than the
r
degree of the numerator. Then the limits in (5 ) exist, and we may start from (5). We
consider the corresponding contour integral
(cid:2)
(5*) f(z) dz
C
around a path C in Fig. 374. Since f(x) is rational, f(z) has finitely many poles in the
upper half-plane, and if we choose R large enough, then C encloses all these poles. By
the residue theorem we then obtain
(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3)R
f (z) dz (cid:4) f (z) dz (cid:5) f (x) dx (cid:4)2pi a Res f (z)

where the sum consists of all the residues of f(z) at the points in the upper half-plane at
which f(z) has a pole. From this we have
(cid:3)R (cid:3)
(6) f (x) dx (cid:4)2pia Res f (z)(cid:2) f (z) dz.
(cid:2)R S
We prove that, if R:(cid:8), the value of the integral over the semicircle S approaches
zero. If we set z(cid:4)Reiu,then Sis represented by R(cid:4)const,and as zranges along S, the
variable u ranges from 0 to p. Since, by assumption, the degree of the denominator of
f(z) is at least two units higher than the degree of the numerator, we have

Fourier Integrals
The method of evaluating (4) by creating a closed contour (Fig. 374) and “blowing it up”
extends to integrals
(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:3)(cid:3)
(8) f(x) cos sx dx and f(x) sin sx dx (s real)
(cid:2)(cid:8) (cid:2)(cid:8)
as they occur in connection with the Fourier integral (Sec. 11.7).
If f(x)is a rational function satisfying the assumption on the degree as for (4), we may
consider the corresponding integral
(cid:2)
f(z)eisz dz (s real and positive)
C
over the contour C in Fig. 374. Instead of (7) we now get
(cid:3)(cid:3)
(9) f (x)eisx dx(cid:4)2piaRes [f (z)eisz] (s(cid:9)0)
(cid:2)(cid:3)
where we sum the residues of f(z)eisz at its poles in the upper half-plane. Equating the
real and the imaginary parts on both sides of (9), we have
(cid:3)(cid:3)
f (x) cos sx dx(cid:4)(cid:2)2p aIm Res [f (z)eisz],
(10) (cid:2) (cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:3) (s(cid:9)0)
f (x) sin sx dx(cid:4)2p aRe Res [f (z)eisz].
(cid:2)(cid:3)
To establish (9), we must show [as for (4)] that the value of the integral over the
semicircle Sin Fig. 374 approaches 0 as R:(cid:8).Now s(cid:9)0and Slies in the upper half-
plane y(cid:12)0. Hence
ƒeiszƒ (cid:4) ƒeis(x(cid:5)iy)ƒ (cid:4) ƒeisxƒƒe(cid:2)syƒ (cid:4)1 # e(cid:2)sy(cid:10)1 (s (cid:9)0, y(cid:12)0).
From this we obtain the inequality ƒf(z)eiszƒ (cid:4) ƒf(z)ƒƒeiszƒ (cid:10) ƒf(z)ƒ (s (cid:9)0, y(cid:12)0).This
reduces our present problem to that for (4). Continuing as before gives (9) and (10). (cid:2)

Another Kind of Improper Integral
We consider an improper integral
(cid:3)B
(11) f(x) dx
A
whose integrand becomes infinite at a point a in the interval of integration,
lim ƒf(x)ƒ (cid:4) (cid:8).
x:a
By definition, this integral (11) means
(cid:3)B (cid:3)a(cid:2)P (cid:3)B
(12) f(x) dx (cid:4) lim f(x) dx (cid:5) lim f(x) dx
P:0 h:0
A A a(cid:5)h
where both P and h approach zero independently and through positive values. It may
happen that neither of these two limits exists if P and h go to 0 independently, but the
limit
(cid:3)a(cid:2)P (cid:3)B
(13) lim f(x) dx (cid:5) f(x) dx
P:0 c d
A a(cid:5)P
exists. This is called the Cauchy principal value of the integral. It is written
(cid:3)B
pr. v. f(x) dx.

For example,

the principal value exists, although the integral itself has no meaning.
In the case of simple poles on the real axis we shall obtain a formula for the principal
value of an integral from (cid:2)(cid:8) to (cid:8).This formula will result from the following theorem.

integral of a rational function f(x)from (cid:2)(cid:8) to (cid:8). For sufficiently large Rthe integral over
the entire contour in Fig. 377 has the value Jgiven by 2pitimes the sum of the residues

approaches the value
K(cid:4)(cid:2)pi Res f(z)
z(cid:4)a
by Theorem 1. Together this shows that the principal value Pof the integral from (cid:2)(cid:8) to
(cid:8) plus K equals J; hence P(cid:4)J(cid:2)K(cid:4)J(cid:5)pi Res f(z). If f(z) has several simple
z(cid:4)a
poles on the real axis, then K will be (cid:2)pi times the sum of the corresponding residues.
Hence the desired formula is
(cid:3)(cid:3)
(14) pr. v. f (x) dx (cid:4)2piaRes f (z)(cid:5) piaRes f (z)
(cid:2)(cid:3)
where the first sum extends over all poles in the upper half-plane and the second over all
poles on the real axis, the latter being simple by assumption.

center z . In A the function f(z) is analytic. At points not in A it may have

singularities. The first series in (1) is a power series. In a given annulus, a Laurent
series of f(z)is unique, but f(z)may have different Laurent series in different annuli
with the same center.
Of particular importance is the Laurent series (1) that converges in a neighborhood
of z except at z itself, say, for 0(cid:3) ƒz(cid:2)z ƒ (cid:3)R (R(cid:9)0, suitable). The series

If the principal part is an infinite series, the singularity of f(z) at z is called an

Section 16.2 also discusses the extended complex plane, that is, the complex plane
with an improper point (cid:8) (“infinity”) attached.
Residue integration may also be used to evaluate certain classes of complicated
real integrals (Sec. 16.4).

Conformal mappings are invaluable to the engineer and physicist as an aid in solving
problems in potential theory. They are a standard method for solving boundary value
problemsin two-dimensional potential theory and yield rich applications in electrostatics,
heat flow, and fluid flow, as we shall see in Chapter 18.
The main feature of conformal mappings is that they are angle-preserving (except at
some critical points) and allow a geometric approach to complex analysis. More details
are as follows. Consider a complex function w(cid:2)f(z)defined in a domain D of the z–plane;
then to each point in D there corresponds a point in the w-plane. In this way we obtain a
mapping of D onto the range of values of f(z)in the w-plane. In Sec. 17.1 we show that
if f(z)is an analytic function, then the mapping given by w(cid:2)f(z)is a conformal mapping,
r
that is, it preserves angles, except at points where the derivative f (z)is zero. (Such points
are called critical points.)
Conformality appeared early in the history of construction of maps of the globe.
Such maps can be either “conformal,” that is, give directions correctly, or “equiareal,”
that is, give areas correctly except for a scale factor. However, the maps will always
be distorted because they cannot have both properties, as can be proven, see [GenRef8]
in App. 1. The designer of accurate maps then has to select which distortion to take
into account.
Our study of conformality is similar to the approach used in calculus where we study
properties of real functions y(cid:2)f(x)and graph them. Here we study the properties of conformal
mappings (Secs. 17.1–17.4) to get a deeper understanding of the properties of functions, most
notably the ones discussed in Chap. 13. Chapter 17 ends with an introduction to Riemann
surfaces,an ingenious geometric way of dealing with multivalued complex functions such as
w(cid:2)sqrt (z)and w(cid:2)ln z.
So far we have covered two main approaches to solving problems in complex analysis.
The first one was solving complex integrals by Cauchy’s integral formula and was broadly
covered by material in Chaps. 13 and 14. The second approach was to use Laurent series
and solve complex integrals by residue integration in Chaps. 15 and 16. Now, in Chaps. 17
and 18, we develop a third approach, that is, the geometric approach of conformal mapping
to solve boundary value problems in complex analysis.

Geometry of Analytic Functions:
Conformal Mapping
We shall see that conformal mappings are those mappings that preserve angles, except at
critical points, and that these mappings are defined by analytic functions. A critical point
occurs wherever the derivative of such a function is zero. To arrive at these results, we
have to define terms more precisely.
A complex function
(1) w(cid:2)f(z)(cid:2)u(x, y) (cid:3)iv(x, y) (z(cid:2)x(cid:3)iy)
of a complex variable z gives a mapping of its domain of definition D in the complex
z-plane intothe complex w-plane or ontoits range of values in that plane.1 For any point z
0
in Dthe point w (cid:2)f(z )is called the imageof z with respect to f. More generally, for
0 0 0
the points of a curve C in D the image points form the image of C; similarly for other
point sets in D. Also, instead of the mapping by a function w(cid:2)f(z) we shall say more
briefly the mapping w(cid:2)f(z).
EXAMPLE 1 Mapping w(cid:2)f(x)(cid:2)z2
Using polar forms z(cid:2)reiuand w(cid:2)Rei(cid:2),we have w(cid:2)z2(cid:2)r2e2iu.Comparing moduli and arguments gives
R(cid:2)r2and (cid:2)(cid:2)2u.Hence circles r(cid:2)r are mapped onto circles R(cid:2)r2and rays u(cid:2)u onto rays (cid:2)(cid:2)2u .

Conformal Mapping
A mapping w(cid:2)f(z)is called conformalif it preserves angles between oriented curves in
magnitude as well as in sense. Figure 380 shows what this means. The anglea (0 (cid:5)a(cid:5)p)
between two intersecting curves C and C is defined to be the angle between their oriented
1 2
tangents at the intersection point z . And conformality means that the images C* and C*
0 1 2
of C and C make the same angle as the curves themselves in both magnitude and direction.

THEOREM 1 Conformality of Mapping by Analytic Functions
The mapping w(cid:2)f(z) by an analytic function f is conformal, except at critical
r
points, that is, points at which the derivative f is zero.
PROOF w(cid:2)z2has a critical point at z(cid:2)0,where fr (z)(cid:2)2z(cid:2)0and the angles are doubled (see
Fig. 378), so that conformality fails.
The idea of proof is to consider a curve
(2) C: z(t)(cid:2)x(t)(cid:3)iy(t)
in the domain of f(z) and to show that w(cid:2)f(z) rotates all tangents at a point z (where
fr (z )(cid:6)0) throug h the same angle. Now z(cid:3) (t )(cid:2)dz dt(cid:2)x(cid:3) (t)(cid:3)iy(cid:3) (t) is tangent0 to C in

The mapping w(cid:2)zn, n(cid:2)2, 3,Á ,is conformal, except at z(cid:2)0,where wr(cid:2)nzn(cid:4)1(cid:2)0.For n(cid:2)2this is
shown in Fig. 378; we see that at 0 the angles are doubled. For general nthe angles at 0 are multiplied by a
factor nunder the mapping. Hence the sector 0(cid:5)u(cid:5)p nis mapped by znonto the upper half-plane v(cid:7)0

EXAMPLE 5 Principle of Inverse Mapping. Mapping w(cid:2)Ln z
Principle.The mapping by the inversez(cid:2)f(cid:4)1(w)ofw(cid:2)f(z)is obtained by interchanging the roles of the
z-plane and the w-plane in the mapping byw(cid:2)f(z).
Now the principal value w(cid:2)f(z)(cid:2)Ln zof the natural logarithm has the inverse z(cid:2)f(cid:4)1(w)(cid:2)ew.From
Example 4 (with the notations zand winterchanged!) we know that f(cid:4)1(w)(cid:2)ewmaps the fundamental region
of the exponential function onto the z-plane without z(cid:2)0(because ew(cid:6)0for every w). Hence w(cid:2)f(z)(cid:2)Ln z
maps the z-plane without the origin and cut along the negative real axis (where u(cid:2)Im Ln z jumps by 2p)
conformally onto the horizontal strip (cid:4)p(cid:9)v(cid:5)pof the w-plane, where w(cid:2)u(cid:3)iv.
Since the mapping w(cid:2)Ln z(cid:3)2pi differs from w(cid:2)Ln z by the translation 2pi (vertically upward), this
function maps the z-plane (cut as before and 0 omitted) onto the strip p(cid:9)v(cid:5)3p. Similarly for each of the
infinitely many mappings w(cid:2)ln z(cid:2)Ln z (cid:8) 2npi (n(cid:2)0, 1, 2,Á ).The corresponding horizontal strips of width
2p(images of the z-plane under these mappings) together cover the whole w-plane without overlapping. (cid:2)

Therefore, the mapping w(cid:2)f(z) magnifies (or shortens) the lengths of short lines by
approximately the factor ƒfr (z )ƒ. The image of a small figure conforms to the original

figure in the sense that it has approximately the same shape. However, since f (z) varies
from point to point, a largefigure may have an image whose shape is quite different from
that of the original figure.

Linear Fractional Transformations
(Möbius Transformations)
Conformal mappings can help in modeling and solving boundary value problems by first
mapping regions conformally onto another. We shall explain this for standard regions
(disks, half-planes, strips) in the next section. For this it is useful to know properties of
special basic mappings. Accordingly, let us begin with the following very important class.
The next two sections discuss linear fractional transformations. The reason for our
thorough study is that such transformations are useful in modeling and solving boundary
value problems, as we shall see in Chapter 18. The task is to get a good grasp of which
c17.qxd 11/1/10 7:35 PM Page 743
SEC. 17.2 Linear Fractional Transformations (Möbius Transformations) 743
conformal mappings map certain regions conformally onto each other, such as, say
mapping a disk onto a half-plane (Sec. 17.3) and so forth. Indeed, the first step in the
modeling process of solving boundary value problems is to identify the correct conformal
mapping that is related to the “geometry” of the boundary value problem.
The following class of conformal mappings is very important. Linear fractional
transformations (or Möbius transformations) are mappings

The proof in this example suggests the use of zand zinstead of xand y, a general principle
that is often quite useful in practice.
Surprisingly, every linear fractional transformation has the property just proved:
THEOREM 1 Circles and Straight Lines
Every linear fractional transformation (1) maps the totality of circles and straight
lines in the z-plane onto the totality of circles and straight lines in the w-plane.
PROOF This is trivial for a translation or rotation, fairly obvious for a uniform expansion or
contraction, and true for w(cid:2)1 z, as just proved. Hence it also holds for composites of
>
these special mappings. Now comes the key idea of the proof: represent (1) in terms of
these special mappings. When c(cid:2)0, this is easy. When c(cid:6)0, the representation is
1 a ad(cid:4)bc
w(cid:2)K cz(cid:3)d (cid:3) c where K(cid:2)(cid:4) c .
This can be verified by substituting K, taking the common denominator and simplifying;
this yields (1). We can now set
1
w (cid:2)cz, w (cid:2)w (cid:3)d, w (cid:2) , w (cid:2)Kw ,
1 2 1 3 w 4 3
2
and see from the previous formula that then w(cid:2)w (cid:3)a c.This tells us that (1) is indeed
4 >
a composite of those special mappings and completes the proof. (cid:2)
Extended Complex Plane
The extended complex plane (the complex plane together with the point (cid:11) in Sec. 16.2)
can now be motivated even more naturally by linear fractional transformations as follows.
To each z for which cz(cid:3)d(cid:6)0 there corresponds a unique w in (1). Now let c(cid:6)0.
Then for z(cid:2)(cid:4)d cwe have cz(cid:3)d(cid:2)0,so that no wcorresponds to this z. This suggests
>
that we let w(cid:2) (cid:11) be the image of z (cid:2)(cid:4)d c.
>
c17.qxd 11/1/10 7:35 PM Page 745
SEC. 17.2 Linear Fractional Transformations (Möbius Transformations) 745
Also, the inverse mapping of (1) is obtained by solving (1) for z; this gives again a
linear fractional transformation
dw(cid:4)b
(4) z(cid:2) (cid:4)cw(cid:3)a.
When c(cid:6)0,then cw(cid:4)a(cid:2)0for w(cid:2)a c,and we let a cbe the image of z(cid:2) (cid:11).With
> >
these settings, the linear fractional transformation (1) is now a one-to-one mapping of the
extended z-plane onto the extended w-plane. We also say that every linear fractional
transformation maps “the extended complex plane in a one-to-one manner onto itself.”
Our discussion suggests the following.
General Remark. If z(cid:2) (cid:11),then the right side of (1) becomes the meaningless expression
# #
(a (cid:11) (cid:3)b) (c (cid:11) (cid:3)d).We assign to it the value w(cid:2)a cif c(cid:6)0and w(cid:2) (cid:11)if c(cid:2)0.
> >
Fixed Points
Fixed pointsof a mapping w(cid:2)f(z)are points that are mapped onto themselves, are “kept
fixed” under the mapping. Thus they are obtained from
w(cid:2)f(z)(cid:2)z.
The identity mapping w(cid:2)z has every point as a fixed point. The mapping w(cid:2)z has
infinitely many fixed points, w(cid:2)1 z has two, a rotation has one, and a translation none
>
in the finite plane. (Find them in each case.) For (1), the fixed-point condition w(cid:2)z is
az(cid:3)b
(5) z(cid:2) , thus cz2(cid:4)(a(cid:4)d)z (cid:4)b(cid:2)0.
cz(cid:3)d
For c(cid:6)0 this is a quadratic equation in z whose coefficients all vanish if and only if the
mapping is the identity mapping w(cid:2)z(in this case, a(cid:2)d(cid:6)0, b(cid:2)c(cid:2)0).Hence we have
THEOREM 2 Fixed Points
A linear fractional transformation, not the identity, has at most two fixed points. If
a linear fractional transformation is known to have three or more fixed points, itmust
be the identity mapping w(cid:2)z.
To make our present general discussion of linear fractional transformations even more
useful from a practical point of view, we extend it by further facts and typical examples,
in the problem set as well as in the next section.

Special Linear Fractional Transformations
We continue our study of linear fractional transformations. We shall identify linear fractional
transformations
az(cid:3)b
(1) w(cid:2) (ad(cid:4)bc(cid:6)0)
cz(cid:3)d
that map certain standard domains onto others. Theorem 1 (below) will give us a tool for
constructing desired linear fractional transformations.
A mapping (1) is determined by a, b,c,d, actually by the ratios of three of these constants
to the fourth because we can drop or introduce a common factor. This makes it plausible
that three conditions determine a unique mapping (1):
THEOREM 1 Three Points and Their Images Given
Three given distinct points z , z , z can always be mapped onto three prescribed
1 2 3
distinct points w , w , w by one, and only one, linear fractional transformation
1 2 3
w(cid:2)f(z). This mapping is given implicitly by the equation
(2) w w(cid:4) (cid:4)w w1 # w w2(cid:4) (cid:4)w w3 (cid:2) zz (cid:4)(cid:4) zz 1 # z z2(cid:4) (cid:4)z z3 .
3 2 1 3 2 1
(If one of these points is the point (cid:11), the quotient of the two differences containing
this point must be replaced by 1.)
PROOF Equation (2) is of the form F(w)(cid:2)G(z) with linear fractional F and G. Hence
w(cid:2)F(cid:4)1(G(z))(cid:2)f(z),
where
F(cid:4)1
is the inverse of F and is linear fractional (see (4) in
c17.qxd 11/1/10 7:35 PM Page 747
SEC. 17.3 Special Linear Fractional Transformations 747
Sec. 17.2) and so is the composite F(cid:4)1(G(z))(by Prob. 2 in Sec. 17.2), that is, w(cid:2)f(z)
is linear fractional. Now if in (2) we set w(cid:2)w , w , w on the left and z(cid:2)z , z , z on
1 2 3 1 2 3
the right, we see that
F(w )(cid:2)0, F(w )(cid:2)1, F(w )(cid:2) (cid:11)
1 2 3
G(z )(cid:2)0, G(z )(cid:2)1, G(z )(cid:2) (cid:11).
1 2 3
From the first column, F(w )(cid:2)G(z ),thus w (cid:2)F(cid:4)1(G(z ))(cid:2)f(z ).Similarly, w (cid:2)f(z ),
1 1 1 1 1 2 2
w (cid:2)f(z ). This proves the existence of the desired linear fractional transformation.
3 3
To prove uniqueness, let w(cid:2)g(z) be a linear fractional transformation, which also
maps z onto w, j(cid:2)1, 2, 3. Thus w (cid:2)g(z ). Hence g(cid:4)1(w)(cid:2)z , where w (cid:2)f(z ).
j j j j j j j j
Together, g(cid:4)1(f(z )) (cid:2)z ,a mapping with the three fixed points z , z , z .By Theorem 2
j j 1 2 3
in Sec. 17.2, this is the identity mapping, g(cid:4)1(f(z))(cid:2)zfor all z. Thus f(z)(cid:2)g(z)for all
z, the uniqueness.
The last statement of Theorem 1 follows from the General Remark in Sec. 17.2. (cid:2)
Mapping of Standard Domains by Theorem 1
Using Theorem 1, we can now find linear fractional transformations of some practically
useful domains (here called “standard domains”) according to the following principle.
Principle. Prescribe three boundary points z , z , z of the domain D in the z-plane.
1 2 3
Choose their images w , w , w on the boundary of the image D* of D in the w-plane.

Obtain the mapping from (2). Make sure that D is mapped onto D*, not onto its
complement. In the latter case, interchange two w-points. (Why does this help?)

Let us show that we can determine the specific properties of such a mapping without much calculation. For
z(cid:2)xwe have w(cid:2)(x(cid:4)i) ((cid:4)ix(cid:3)1),thus ƒwƒ (cid:2)1,so that the x-axis maps onto the unit circle. Since z(cid:2)i

gives w(cid:2)0,the upper half-plane maps onto the interior of that circle and the lower half-plane onto the exterior.
z(cid:2)0, i, (cid:11)go onto w(cid:2)(cid:4)i, 0, i,so that the positive imaginary axis maps onto the segment S:u(cid:2)0, (cid:4)1(cid:5)v(cid:5)1.
The vertical lines x(cid:2)constmap onto circles (by Theorem 1, Sec. 17.2) through w(cid:2)i(the image of z(cid:2)(cid:11)) and
perpendicular to ƒwƒ (cid:2)1 (by conformality; see Fig. 388). Similarly, the horizontal lines y(cid:2)const map onto
circles through w(cid:2)iand perpendicular to S(by conformality). Figure 388 gives these circles for y(cid:7)0,and for
y(cid:9)0they lie outside the unit disk shown. (cid:2)

which we had to replace by 1.
EXAMPLE 3 Mapping of a Disk onto a Half-Plane
Find the linear fractional transformation that maps z (cid:2)(cid:4)1, z (cid:2)i, z (cid:2)1 onto w (cid:2)0, w (cid:2)i, w (cid:2)(cid:11),

respectively, such that the unit disk is mapped onto the right half-plane. (Sketch disk and half-plane.)

Mapping half-planes onto half-planesis another task of practical interest. For instance,
we may wish to map the upper half-plane y(cid:7)0 onto the upper half-plane v(cid:7)0. Then
the x-axis must be mapped onto the u-axis.
EXAMPLE 4 Mapping of a Half-Plane onto a Half-Plane
Find the linear fractional transformation that maps z (cid:2)(cid:4)2, z (cid:2)0, z (cid:2)2 onto w (cid:2)(cid:11), w (cid:2)1, w (cid:2)3,

Mappings of disks onto disks is a third class of practical problems. We may readily
verify that the unit disk in the z-plane is mapped onto the unit disk in the w-plane by the
following function, which maps z onto the center w(cid:2)0.

transformations (Secs. 17.2 and 17.3).

Hence
(2) u(cid:2)sin x cosh y, v(cid:2)cos x sinh y.
Since sin z is periodic with period 2p, the mapping is certainly not one-to-one if we
consider it in the full z-plane. We restrict z to the vertical strip S:(cid:4)1p (cid:5) x(cid:5)1p in
2 2
Fig. 391. Since fr (z)(cid:2)cos z (cid:2)0at z(cid:2)(cid:8)1p,the mapping is not conformal at these two

critical points. We claim that the rectangular net of straight lines x(cid:2)constand y(cid:2)const
in Fig. 391 is mapped onto a net in the w-plane consisting of hyperbolas (the images of
the vertical lines x(cid:2)const) and ellipses (the images of the horizontal lines y(cid:2)const)
intersecting the hyperbolas at right angles (conformality!). Corresponding calculations are
simple. From (2) and the relations sin2 x(cid:3)cos2 x(cid:2)1 and cosh2 y(cid:4)sinh2 y(cid:2)1 we

Cosine Function. The mapping w(cid:2)cos zcould be discussed independently, but since
(3) w(cid:2)cos z (cid:2)sin (z (cid:3)1p),
2
we see at once that this is the same mapping as sin zpreceded by a translation to the right
through 1punits.

Hyperbolic Sine. Since
(4) w(cid:2)sinh z(cid:2)(cid:4)i sin (iz),
the mapping is a counterclockwise rotation Z(cid:2)izthrough 1p(i.e., 90°),followed by the
sine mapping Z*(cid:2)sin Z, followed by a clockwise
90°-rot2
a tion w(cid:2)(cid:4)iZ*.
Hyperbolic Cosine. This function
(5) w(cid:2)cosh z (cid:2)cos (iz)
defines a mapping that is a rotation Z(cid:2)iz followed by the mapping w(cid:2)cos Z.
Figure 393 shows the mapping of a semi-infinite strip onto a half-plane by w(cid:2)cosh z.
Since cosh 0(cid:2)1, the point z(cid:2)0 is mapped onto w(cid:2)1. For real z(cid:2)x(cid:7)0, cosh z is
real and increases with increasing x in a monotone fashion, starting from 1. Hence the
positive x-axis is mapped onto the portion u(cid:7)1 of the u-axis.
For pure imaginary z(cid:2)iywe have cosh iy(cid:2)cos y.Hence the left boundary of the strip
is mapped onto the segment 1(cid:7)u(cid:7)(cid:4)1of the u-axis, the point z(cid:2)picorresponding to
w(cid:2)cosh ip(cid:2)cos p(cid:2)(cid:4)1.
On the upper boundary of the strip, y(cid:2)p, and since sin p(cid:2)0 and cos p (cid:2)(cid:4)1, it
follows that this part of the boundary is mapped onto the portion u(cid:5)(cid:4)1 of the u-axis.
Hence the boundary of the strip is mapped onto the u-axis. It is not difficult to see that
the interior of the strip is mapped onto the upper half of the w-plane, and the mapping is
one-to-one.
This mapping in Fig. 393 has applications in potential theory, as we shall see in Prob. 12
of Sec. 18.3.

We now see that w(cid:2)tan zis a linear fractional transformation preceded by an exponential
mapping (see Sec. 17.1) and followed by a clockwise rotation through an angle 1p(90°).

The strip is S:(cid:4)1p(cid:9)x(cid:9)1p, and we show that it is mapped onto the unit disk in
4 4
the w-plane. Since Z(cid:2)e2iz(cid:2)e(cid:4)2y(cid:3)2ix, we see from (10) in Sec. 13.5 that ƒZƒ (cid:2)e(cid:4)2y,

the unit circle ƒZƒ (cid:2)1 and the lower half of S outside ƒZƒ (cid:2)1, as shown in Fig. 394.
Now comes the linear fractional transformation in (6), which we denote by g(Z):
Z(cid:4)1
(7) W(cid:2)g(Z) (cid:2) .
Z(cid:3)1
For real Zthis is real. Hence the real Z-axis is mapped onto the real W-axis. Furthermore,
the imaginary Z-axis is mapped onto the unit circle ƒWƒ (cid:2)1because for pure imaginary
Z(cid:2)iY we get from (7)
iY(cid:4)1
ƒWƒ (cid:2) ƒg(iY)ƒ (cid:2) (cid:2)1.

The right Z-half-plane is mapped inside this unit circle ƒWƒ (cid:2)1, not outside, because
Z(cid:2)1has its image g(1) (cid:2)0inside that circle. Finally, the unit circle ƒZƒ (cid:2)1is mapped
onto the imaginary W-axis, because this circle is

Riemann Surfaces. Optional
One of the simplest but most ingeneous ideas in complex analysis is that of Riemann
surfaces. They allow multivalued relations, such as w(cid:2) 1z or w(cid:2)ln z, to become
single-valued and therefore functions in the usual sense. This works because the Riemann
surfaces consist of several sheets that are connected at certain points (called branch points).
Thus w(cid:2) 1zwill need two sheets, being single-valued on each sheet. How many sheets
do you think w(cid:2)ln z needs? Can you guess, by recalling Sec. 13.7? (The answer will
be given at the end of this section). Let us start our systematic discussion.
The mapping given by
(1) w(cid:2)u(cid:3)iv(cid:2)z2 (Sec. 17.1)
c17.qxd 11/1/10 7:36 PM Page 755
SEC. 17.5 Riemann Surfaces. Optional 755
is conformal, except at z(cid:2)0, where wr (cid:2)2z(cid:2)0, At z(cid:2)0, angles are doubled under
the mapping. Thus the right z-half-plane (including the positive y-axis) is mapped onto
the full w-plane, cut along the negative half of the u-axis; this mapping is one-to-one.
Similarly for the left z-half-plane (including the negative y-axis). Hence the image of the
full z-plane under w(cid:2)z2“covers the w-plane twice” in the sense that every w(cid:6)0is the
image of two z-points; if z is one, the other is (cid:4)z . For example, z(cid:2)i and (cid:4)i are both
1 1
mapped onto w(cid:2)(cid:4)1.
Now comes the crucial idea. We place those two copies of the cut w-plane upon each
other so that the upper sheet is the image of the right half z-plane R and the lower sheet
is the image of the left half z-plane L. We join the two sheets crosswise along the cuts
(along the negative u-axis) so that if z moves from R to L, its image can move from the
upper to the lower sheet. The two origins are fastened together because w(cid:2)0is the image
of just one z-point, z(cid:2)0.The surface obtained is called a Riemann surface(Fig. 395a).
w(cid:2)0 is called a “winding point” or branch point. w(cid:2)z2 maps the full z-plane onto
this surface in a one-to-one manner.
By interchanging the roles of the variables z and w it follows that the double-valued
relation
(2) w(cid:2) 1z (Sec. 13.2)
becomes single-valued on the Riemann surface in Fig. 395a, that is, a function in the usual
sense. We can let the upper sheet correspond to the principal value of 1z. Its image is
the right w-half-plane. The other sheet is then mapped onto the left w-half-plane.
3
(a) Riemann surface of z (b) Riemann surface of z
Fig. 395. Riemann surfaces
Similarly, the triple-valued relation w(cid:2) 13zbecomes single-valued on the three-sheeted
Riemann surface in Fig. 395b, which also has a branch point at z(cid:2)0.
The infinitely many-valued natural logarithm (Sec. 13.7)
w(cid:2)ln z (cid:2)Ln z (cid:3)2npi (n(cid:2)0, (cid:8)1, (cid:8)2,Á )
becomes single-valued on a Riemann surface consisting of infinitely many sheets,
w(cid:2)Ln zcorresponds to one of them. This sheet is cut along the negative x-axis and the
upper edge of the slit is joined to the lower edge of the next sheet, which corresponds to
the argument p(cid:9)u(cid:5)3p, that is, to
w(cid:2)Ln z (cid:3)2pi.
The principal value Ln z maps its sheet onto the horizontal strip (cid:4)p (cid:9)v(cid:5)p. The
function w(cid:2)Ln z (cid:3)2pimaps its sheet onto the neighboring strip p(cid:9)v(cid:5)3p,and so
on. The mapping of the points z(cid:6)0of the Riemann surface onto the points of the w-plane
is one-to-one. See also Example 5 in Sec. 17.1.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Conformal Mapping
A complex function w(cid:2)f(z) gives a mapping of its domain of definition in the
complex z-plane onto its range of values in the complex w-plane. If f(z)is analytic,
this mapping is conformal, that is, angle-preserving: the images of any two
intersecting curves make the same angle of intersection, in both magnitude and sense,
as the curves themselves (Sec. 17.1). Exceptions are the points at which fr (z)(cid:2)0
(“critical points,” e.g. z(cid:2)0 for w(cid:2)z2).
For mapping properties of ez, cos z, sin z etc. see Secs. 17.1 and 17.4.
Linear fractional transformations, also called Möbius transformations
az(cid:3)b

cz(cid:3)d
(ad(cid:4)bc(cid:6)0)map the extended complex plane (Sec. 17.2) onto itself. They solve
the problems of mapping half-planes onto half-planes or disks, and disks onto disks
or half-planes. Prescribing the images of three points determines (1) uniquely.
Riemann surfaces(Sec. 17.5) consist of several sheets connected at certain points
called branch points.On them, multivalued relations become single-valued, that is,
functions in the usual sense. Examples.For w(cid:2) 1zwe need two sheets (with branch
point 0) since this relation is doubly-valued. For w(cid:2)ln zwe need infinitely many
sheets since this relation is infinitely many-valued (see Sec. 13.7).

Complex Analysis
and Potential Theory
In Chapter 17 we developed the geometric approach of conformal mapping. This meant
that, for a complex analytic function w(cid:4)f(z) defined in a domain D of the z-plane, we
associated with each point in D a corresponding point in the w-plane. This gave us a
conformal mapping (angle-preserving), except at critical points where fr (z)(cid:4)0.
Now, in this chapter, we shall apply conformal mappings to potential problems. This
will lead to boundary value problems and many engineering applications in electrostatics,
heat flow, and fluid flow. More details are as follows.
Recall that Laplace’s equation (cid:3)2£ (cid:4)0 is one of the most important PDEs in
engineering mathematics because it occurs in gravitation (Secs. 9.7, 12.11), electrostatics
(Sec. 9.7), steady-state heat conduction (Sec. 12.5), incompressible fluid flow, and other
areas. The theory of this equation is called potential theory (although “potential” is also
used in a more general sense in connection with gradients (see Sec. 9.7)). Because we
want to treat this equation with complex analytic methods, we restrict our discussion to
the “two-dimensional case.” Then £ depends only on two Cartesian coordinates x and y,
and Laplace’s equation becomes
(cid:3)2£ (cid:4) £ (cid:2) £ (cid:4)0.
xx yy
An important idea then is that its solutions £ are closely related to complex analytic
functions £ (cid:2)i° as shown in Sec. 13.4. (Remark:We use the notation £ (cid:2)i° to free
u and v, which will be needed in conformal mapping u(cid:2)iv.) This important relation is
the main reason for using complex analysis in problems of physics and engineering.
We shall examine this connection between Laplace’s equation and complex analytic
functions and illustrate it by modeling applications from electrostatics (Secs. 18.1,
18.2), heat conduction (Sec. 18.3), and hydrodynamics (Sec. 18.4). This in turn will
lead to boundary value problems in two-dimensional potential theory. As a result,
some of the functions of Chap. 17 will be used to transform complicated regions into
simpler ones.
Section 18.5 will derive the important Poisson formula for potentials in a circular disk.
Section 18.6 will deal with harmonic functions, which, as you recall, are solutions of
Laplace’s equation and have continuous second partial derivatives. In that section we will
show how results on analytic functions can be used to characterize properties of harmonic
functions.

18.1
Electrostatic Fields
The electrical force of attraction or repulsion between charged particles is governed by
Coulomb’s law (see Sec. 9.7). This force is the gradient of a function £, called the
electrostatic potential. At any points free of charges, £is a solution of Laplace’s equation
(cid:3)2£ (cid:4)0.
The surfaces £ (cid:4)const are called equipotential surfaces. At each point P at which
the gradient of £ is not the zero vector, it is perpendicular to the surface £ (cid:4)const
through P; that is, the electrical force has the direction perpendicular to the equipotential
surface. (See also Secs. 9.7 and 12.11.)
y The problems we shall discuss in this entire chapter are two-dimensional (for the
reason just given in the chapter opening), that is, they model physical systems that lie
in three-dimensional space (of course!), but are such that the potential £ is independent
of one of the space coordinates, so that £ depends only on two coordinates, which we
call x and y. Then Laplace’s equation becomes

Equipotential surfaces now appear as equipotential lines (curves) in the xy-plane.

in Example 1 Let us illustrate these ideas by a few simple examples.
EXAMPLE 1 Potential Between Parallel Plates
Find the potential £of the field between two parallel conducting plates extending to infinity (Fig. 396), which
are kept at potentials £ and £ ,respectively.
1 2
Solution. From the shape of the plates it follows that £depends only on x, and Laplace’s equation becomes
£s(cid:4)0.By integrating twice we obtain £(cid:4)ax(cid:2)b,where the constants aand bare determined by the given
boundary values of £on the plates. For example, if the plates correspond to x(cid:4)(cid:5)1and x(cid:4)1,the solution is
£(x)(cid:4)1(£ (cid:5)£ )x(cid:2)1(£ (cid:2)£ ).

EXAMPLE 2 Potential Between Coaxial Cylinders
Find the potential £ between two coaxial conducting cylinders extending to infinity on both ends (Fig. 397)
and kept at potentials £ and £ ,respectively.

Solution. Here £ depends only on r(cid:4) 2x2(cid:2)y2, for reasons of symmetry, and Laplace’s equation
r2u (cid:2)ru (cid:2)u (cid:4)0 [(5), Sec. 12.10] with u (cid:4)0 and u(cid:4)£ becomes r£s(cid:2)£r(cid:4)0. By separating

Complex Potential
Let £(x, y)be harmonic in some domain Dand °(x, y)a harmonic conjugate of £ in D.
(Note the change of notation from uand vof Sec. 13.4 to £and °. From the next section
on, we had to free u and v for use in conformal mapping. Then
(2) F(z) (cid:4) £(x, y) (cid:2)i°(x, y)
is an analytic function of z(cid:4)x(cid:2)iy. This function F is called the complex potential
corresponding to the real potential £.Recall from Sec. 13.4 that for given £,a conjugate
° is uniquely determined except for an additive real constant. Hence we may say the
complex potential, without causing misunderstandings.
The use of F has two advantages, a technical one and a physical one. Technically, F
is easier to handle than real or imaginary parts, in connection with methods of complex
analysis. Physically, ° has a meaning. By conformality, the curves ° (cid:4)constintersect
the equipotential lines £ (cid:4)constin the xy-plane at right angles [except where Fr (z)(cid:4)0].
Hence they have the direction of the electrical force and, therefore, are called lines
of force. They are the paths of moving charged particles (electrons in an electron
microscope, etc.).

EXAMPLE 4 Complex Potential
In Example 1, a conjugate is °(cid:4)ay.It follows that the complex potential is
F(z)(cid:4)az(cid:2)b(cid:4)ax(cid:2)b(cid:2)iay,
and the lines of force are horizontal straight lines y(cid:4)constparallel to the x-axis. (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 5 Complex Potential
In Example 2 we have £(cid:4)a ln r(cid:2)b(cid:4)a ln ƒzƒ (cid:2)b. A conjugate is °(cid:4)a Arg z. Hence the complex
potential is
F(z)(cid:4)a Ln z(cid:2)b
and the lines of force are straight lines through the origin. F(z)may also be interpreted as the complex potential
(cid:2)
of a source line (a wire perpendicular to the xy-plane) whose trace in the xy-plane is the origin.
EXAMPLE 6 Complex Potential
In Example 3 we get F(z)by noting that i Ln z(cid:4)i ln ƒzƒ (cid:5)Arg z,multiplying this by (cid:5)b,and adding a:
F(z)(cid:4)a(cid:5)ib Ln z(cid:4)a(cid:2)b Arg z(cid:5)ib ln ƒzƒ.
We see from this that the lines of force are concentric circles ƒzƒ (cid:4)const.Can you sketch them? (cid:2)
Superposition
More complicated potentials can often be obtained by superposition.
EXAMPLE 7 Potential of a Pair of Source Lines (a Pair of Charged Wires)
Determine the potential of a pair of oppositely charged source lines of the same strength at the points z(cid:4)cand
z(cid:4)(cid:5)con the real axis.
Solution. From Examples 2 and 5 it follows that the potential of each of the source lines is
£ (cid:4)K ln ƒz(cid:5)cƒ and £ (cid:4)(cid:5)K ln ƒz(cid:2)cƒ,
1 2
respectively. Here the real constant Kmeasures the strength (amount of charge). These are the real parts of the
complex potentials
F (z)(cid:4)K Ln (z(cid:5)c) and F (z)(cid:4)(cid:5)K Ln (z(cid:2)c).
1 2
Hence the complex potential of the combination of the two source lines is
(3) F(z)(cid:4)F (z)(cid:2)F (z)(cid:4)K [Ln (z(cid:5)c)(cid:5)Ln (z(cid:2)c)].

These are circles, as you may show by direct calculation. The lines of forceare
°(cid:4)Im F(z)(cid:4)K[Arg (z(cid:5)c)(cid:5)Arg (z(cid:2)c)](cid:4)const.
We write this briefly (Fig. 399)
°(cid:4)K(u (cid:5)u )(cid:4)const.

762 CHAP. 18 Complex Analysis and Potential Theory
Now u (cid:5)u is the angle between the line segments from zto cand (cid:5)c(Fig. 399). Hence the lines of force
1 2
are the curves along each of which the line segment S: (cid:5)c(cid:8)x(cid:8)cappears under a constant angle. These curves
are the totality of circular arcs over S, as is (or should be) known from elementary geometry. Hence the lines
of force are circles. Figure 400 shows some of them together with some equipotential lines.
In addition to the interpretation as the potential of two source lines, this potential could also be thought of as
the potential between two circular cylinders whose axes are parallel but do not coincide, or as the potential
between two equal cylinders that lie outside each other, or as the potential between a cylinder and a plane wall.
(cid:2)
Explain this using Fig. 400.
The idea of the complex potential as just explained is the key to a close relation of potential
theory to complex analysis and will recur in heat flow and fluid flow.

Use of Conformal Mapping. Modeling
We have just explored the close relation between potential theory and complex analysis.
This relationship is so close because complex potentials can be modeled in complex
analysis. In this section we shall explore the close relation that results from the use of
conformal mapping in modeling and solving boundary value problems for the Laplace
equation. The process consists of finding a solution of the equation in some domain,
assuming given values on the boundary (Dirichlet problem, see also Sec. 12.6). The key
idea is then to use conformal mapping to map a given domain onto one for which the
solution is known or can be found more easily. This solution thus obtained is then mapped
back to the given domain. The reason this approach works is due to Theorem 1, which
asserts that harmonic functions remain harmonic under conformal mapping:
THEOREM 1 Harmonic Functions Under Conformal Mapping
Let£*be harmonic in a domain D*in the w-plane. Suppose that w(cid:4)u(cid:2)iv(cid:4)f(z)
is analytic in a domain D in the z-plane and maps D conformally onto D*. Then
the function
(1) £(x, y) (cid:4) £*(u(x, y), v(x, y))
is harmonic in D.
PROOF The composite of analytic functions is analytic, as follows from the chain rule. Hence, taking
a harmonic conjugate °*(u, v) of £*, as defined in Sec. 13.4, and forming the analytic
function F*(w)(cid:4) £*(u, v)(cid:2)i°*(u, v)we conclude that F(z) (cid:4)F*( f(z))is analytic in D.
Hence its real part £(x, y) (cid:4)Re F(z)is harmonic in D. This completes the proof.
We mention without proof that if D*is simply connected (Sec. 14.2), then a harmonic
conjugate of £* exists. Another proof of Theorem 1 without the use of a harmonic
conjugate is given in App. 4. (cid:2)

hence k(cid:4)0. If ƒwƒ (cid:4)r (cid:4)1,then £*(cid:4)a ln (1)(cid:4)110,hence a(cid:4)110 ln (1)(cid:4)(cid:5)158.7.Substitution of (3)

The boundary ƒzƒ (cid:4)1is mapped onto the boundary u(cid:4)0(the v-axis), with z(cid:4)(cid:5)1, i, 1going onto w(cid:4)0, i, (cid:9),
respectively, and z(cid:4)(cid:5)ionto w(cid:4)(cid:5)i.Hence the upper semicircle of ƒzƒ (cid:4)1is mapped onto the upper half,
and the lower semicircle onto the lower half of the v-axis, so that the boundary conditions in the w-plane are
as indicated in Fig. 406.
Step 2. We determine the potential £*(u, v)in the right half-plane of the w-plane. Example 3 in Sec. 18.1 with
a(cid:4)p, U (cid:4)(cid:5)3000,and U (cid:4)3000[with £*(u, v)instead of £(x, y)]yields

£(x, y)(cid:4)Re F(z)(cid:4) p Im Ln 1(cid:5)z(cid:4) p Arg 1(cid:5)z .
As in Example 1 we conclude that the equipotential lines £(x, y)(cid:4)const are circular arcs because they
correspond to Arg [(1(cid:2)z) (1(cid:5)z)](cid:4)const,hence to Arg w(cid:4)const.Also, Arg w(cid:4)constare rays from 0
>
to (cid:9), the images of z(cid:4)(cid:5)1 and z(cid:4)1, respectively. Hence the equipotential lines all have (cid:5)1 and 1 (the
points where the boundary potential jumps) as their endpoints (Fig. 405). The lines of force are circular arcs,
too, and since they must be orthogonal to the equipotential lines, their centers can be obtained as intersections
(cid:2)
of tangents to the unit circle with the x-axis, (Explain!)
Further examples can easily be constructed. Just take any mapping w(cid:4)f(z)in Chap. 17,
a domain Din the z-plane, its image D*in the w-plane, and a potential £*in D*.Then(1)
gives a potential in D. Make up some examples of your own, involving, for instance,
linear fractional transformations.

Basic Comment on Modeling
We formulated the examples in this section as models on the electrostatic potential. It is
quite important to realize that this is accidental. We could equally well have phrased
everything in terms of (time-independent) heat flow; then instead of voltages we would
have had temperatures, the equipotential lines would have become isotherms ((cid:4) lines of
constant temperature), and the lines of the electrical force would have become lines along
which heat flows from higher to lower temperatures (more on this in the next section).
Or we could have talked about fluid flow; then the electrostatic lines of force would have
become streamlines (more on this in Sec. 18.4). What we again see here is the unifying
power of mathematics: different phenomena and systems from different areas in physics
having the same types of model can be treated by the same mathematical methods. What
differs from area to area is just the kinds of problems that are of practical interest.

Heat Problems
Heat conduction in a body of homogeneous material is modeled by the heat equation
T (cid:4)c2(cid:3)2T
t
where the function T is temperature, T (cid:4) 0T 0t, t is time, and c2 is a positive constant
t >
(specific to the material of the body; see Sec. 12.6).
Now if a heat flow problem is steady, that is, independent of time, we have T (cid:4)0.If
t
it is also two-dimensional, then the heat equation reduces to
(1) (cid:3)2T(cid:4)T (cid:2)T (cid:4)0,
xx yy
which is the two-dimensional Laplace equation. Thus we have shown that we can model
a two-dimensional steady heat flow problem by Laplace’s equation.
Furthermore we can treat this heat flow problem by methods of complex analysis, since
T (or T(x, y)) is the real part of the complex heat potential
F(z) (cid:4)T(x, y) (cid:2)i°(x, y).
We call T(x, y)the heat potential. The curves T(x, y) (cid:4)constare called isotherms,which
means lines of constant temperature. The curves °(x, y) (cid:4)const are called heat flow
lines because heat flows along them from higher temperatures to lower temperatures.
It follows that all the examples considered so far (Secs. 18.1, 18.2) can now be
reinterpreted as problems on heat flow. The electrostatic equipotential lines £(x, y)(cid:4)const

Mathematically the calculations remain the same in the transition to another field of
application. Physically, new problems may arise, with boundary conditions that would
make no sense physically or would be of no practical interest. This is illustrated by the
next two examples.
EXAMPLE 3 A Mixed Boundary Value Problem
Find the temperature distribution in the region in Fig. 410 (cross section of a solid quarter-cylinder), whose
vertical portion of the boundary is at 20°C,the horizontal portion at 50°C,and the circular portion is insulated.
Solution. The insulated portion of the boundary must be a heat flow line, since, by the insulation, heat is
prevented from crossing such a curve, hence heat must flow along the curve. Thus the isotherms must meet
such a curve at right angles. Since Tis constant along an isotherm, this means that

and 0T 0non the other portion is called a mixed boundary value problem.
>
In our case, the normal direction to the insulated circular boundary curve is the radial direction toward the
origin. Hence (2) becomes 0T 0r(cid:4)0,meaning that along this curve the solution must not depend on r. Now

EXAMPLE 4 Another Mixed Boundary Value Problem in Heat Conduction
Find the temperature field in the upper half-plane when the x-axis is kept at T(cid:4)0°Cfor x(cid:7)(cid:5)1,is insulated
for (cid:5)1(cid:7)x(cid:7)1,and is kept at T(cid:4)20°Cfor x(cid:10)1(Fig. 411).
Solution. We map the half-plane in Fig. 411 onto the vertical strip in Fig. 412, find the temperature T*(u, v)
there, and map it back to get the temperature T(x, y)in the half-plane.
The idea of using that strip is suggested by Fig. 391 in Sec. 17.4 with the roles of z(cid:4)x(cid:2)iyand w(cid:4)u(cid:2)iv
interchanged. The figure shows that z(cid:4)sin wmaps our present strip onto our half-plane in Fig. 411. Hence the
inverse function
w(cid:4)f(z)(cid:4)arcsin z
maps that half-plane onto the strip in the w-plane. This is the mapping function that we need according to
Theorem 1 in Sec. 18.2.
The insulated segment (cid:5)1(cid:7)x(cid:7)1on the x-axis maps onto the segment (cid:5)p 2(cid:7)u(cid:7)p 2on the u-axis.
> >
The rest of the x-axis maps onto the two vertical boundary portions u(cid:4)(cid:5)p 2and p 2, v(cid:10)0,of the strip.

This gives the transformed boundary conditions in Fig. 412 for T*(u, v), where on the insulated horizontal
boundary, 0T* 0n(cid:4)0T* 0v(cid:4)0because vis a coordinate normal to that segment.

Similarly to Example 1 we obtain

T*(u, v)(cid:4)10(cid:2) u
p
which satisfies all the boundary conditions. This is the real part of the complex potential F*(w)(cid:4)10(cid:2)(20 p)w.

Hence the complex potential in the z-plane is
20
F(z)(cid:4)F*( f(z))(cid:4)10(cid:2) arcsin z
p
and T(x, y)(cid:4)Re F(z)is the solution. The isotherms are u(cid:4)constin the strip and the hyperbolas in the z-plane,
perpendicular to which heat flows along the dashed ellipses from the 20°-portion to the cooler 0°-portion of the
(cid:2)
boundary, a physically very reasonable result.
Sections 18.3 and 18.5 show some of the usefulness of conformal mappings and complex
potentials. Furthermore, complex potential models fluid flow in Sec. 18.4.

Fluid Flow
Laplace’s equation also plays a basic role in hydrodynamics, in steady nonviscous fluid
flow under physical conditions discussed later in this section. For methods of complex
analysis to be applicable, our problems will be two-dimensional, so that the velocity vector
V by which the motion of the fluid can be given depends only on two space variables x
and y, and the motion is the same in all planes parallel to the xy-plane.
Then we can use for the velocity vector V a complex function
(1) V(cid:4)V (cid:2)iV

giving the magnitude ƒVƒ and direction Arg V of the velocity at each point z(cid:4)x(cid:2)iy.

Whereas in electrostatics the boundaries (conducting plates) are equipotential lines, in
fluid flow the boundaries across which fluid cannot flow must be streamlines. Hence in
fluid flow the stream function is of particular importance.
Before discussing the conditions for the validity of the statements involving (2)–(5), let
us consider two flows of practical interest, so that we first see what is going on from a
practical point of view. Further flows are included in the problem set.

In particular, °(x, y)(cid:4)0 gives r(cid:5)1 r(cid:4)0 or sin u(cid:4)0. Hence this streamline consists of the unit circle

flow around a long circular cylinder of unit radius that is perpendicular to the z-plane and intersects it in the
unit circle ƒzƒ (cid:4)1and whose axis corresponds to z(cid:4)0.
The flow has two stagnation points(that is, points at which the velocity Vis zero), at z(cid:4)(cid:11)1.This follows

Assumptions and Theory Underlying (2)–(5)
THEOREM 1 Complex Potential of a Flow
If the domain of flow is simply connected and the flow is irrotational and
incompressible, then the statements involving (2)–(5) hold. In particular, then the
flow has a complex potential F(z), which is an analytic function. (Explanation of
terms below.)
PROOF We prove this theorem, along with a discussion of basic concepts related to fluid flow.
(a) First Assumption: Irrotational. Let Cbe any smooth curve in the z-plane given
by z(s)(cid:4)x(s)(cid:2)iy(s), where s is the arc length of C. Let the real variable V be the
t
component of the velocity V tangent to C (Fig. 417). Then the value of the real line

taken along C in the sense of increasing s is called the circulation of the fluid along C,
a name that will be motivated as we proceed in this proof. Dividing the circulation by the
length of C, we obtain the mean velocity1 of the flow along the curve C. Now

The circulation (6) along C now becomes

(7) V ds(cid:4) (V dx(cid:2)V dy).

C C
As the next idea, let Cbe a closed curvesatisfying the assumption as in Green’s theorem
(Sec. 10.4), and let Cbe the boundary of a simply connected domain D. Suppose further
that V has continuous partial derivatives in a domain containing D and C. Then we can
use Green’s theorem to represent the circulation around C by a double integral,
(cid:4) (cid:2)(cid:2) 0V 0V
(8) (V dx(cid:2)V dy)(cid:4) 2 (cid:5) 1 dx dy.

The integrand of this double integral is called the vorticity of the flow. The vorticity

If we now let r:0,the limit of v is the value of vat the center of C. Hence v(x, y)is
0
the limiting angular velocity of a circular element of the fluid as the circle shrinks to the
point (x, y). Roughly speaking, if a spherical element of the fluid were suddenly solidified
and the surrounding fluid simultaneously annihilated, the element would rotate with the
angular velocity v.
(b) Second Assumption: Incompressible. Our second assumption is that the fluid is
incompressible. (Fluids include liquids, which are incompressible, and gases, such as air,
which are compressible.) Then
0V 0V
(11) 1 (cid:2) 2 (cid:4)0

in every region that is free of sources or sinks, that is, points at which fluid is produced
or disappears, respectively. The expression in (11) is called the divergence of V and is
denoted by div V. (See also (7) in Sec. 9.8.)
(c) Complex Velocity Potential. If the domain D of the flow is simply connected
(Sec. 14.2) and the flow is irrotational, then (10) implies that the line integral (7) is
independent of path in D (by Theorem 3 in Sec. 10.2, where F (cid:4)V, F (cid:4)V, F (cid:4)0,
1 1 2 2 3
and z is the third coordinate in space and has nothing to do with our present z). Hence if
we integrate from a fixed point (a, b) in D to a variable point (x, y) in D, the integral
becomes a function of the point (x, y), say, £(x, y):
(cid:2)(x,y)
(12) £(x, y) (cid:4) (V dx(cid:2)V dy).
1 2
(a,b)
We claim that the flow has a velocity potential £, which is given by (12). To prove
this, all we have to do is to show that (4) holds. Now since the integral (7) is
independent of path, V dx(cid:2)V dy is exact (Sec. 10.2), namely, the differential of £,
1 2
that is,
0£ 0£
V dx(cid:2)V dy(cid:4) dx(cid:2) dy.
1 2 0x 0y
From this we see that V (cid:4) 0£ 0x and V (cid:4) 0£ 0y, which gives (4).
1 > 2 >
That £ is harmonic follows at once by substituting (4) into (11), which gives the first
Laplace equation in (5).
We finally take a harmonic conjugate ° of £. Then the other equation in (5) holds.
Also, since the second partial derivatives of £ and ° are continuous, we see that the
complex function
F(z) (cid:4) £(x, y) (cid:2)i°(x, y)
c18.qxd 11/2/10 6:55 PM Page 776
776 CHAP. 18 Complex Analysis and Potential Theory
is analytic in D. Since the curves °(x, y) (cid:4)const are perpendicular to the equipotential
curves £(x, y)(cid:4)const (except where Fr (z)(cid:4)0), we conclude that °(x, y) (cid:4)const are
the streamlines. Hence ° is the stream function and F(z) is the complex potential of the
flow. This completes the proof of Theorem 1 as well as our discussion of the important
role of complex analysis in compressible fluid flow. (cid:2)

Poisson’s Integral Formula for Potentials
So far in this chapter we have seen powerful methods based on conformal mappings and
complex potentials. They were used for modeling and solving two-dimensional potential
problems and demonstrated the importance of complex analysis.
Now we introduce a further method that results from complex integration. It will yield
the very important Poisson integral formula (5) for potentials in a standard domain

(acircular disk). In addition, from (5), we will derive a useful series (7) for these potentials.
This allows us to solve problems for disks and then map solutions conformally onto other
domains.
Derivation of Poisson’s Integral Formula
Poisson’s formula will follow from Cauchy’s integral formula (Sec. 14.3)

Here Cis the circle z*(cid:4)Reia(counterclockwise, 0(cid:8)a(cid:8)2p),and we assume that F(z*)

Now comes a little trick. If instead of zinside Cwe take a Zoutside C, the integrals (1)
and (2) are zero by Cauchy’s integral theorem (Sec. 14.2). We choose Z(cid:4)z*z* z (cid:4)R2 z,

which is outside Cbecause ƒZƒ (cid:4)R2 ƒzƒ (cid:4)R2 r(cid:10)R. From (2) we thus have

We subtract this from (2) and use the following formula that you can verify by direct
calculation (zz* cancels):
z* z z*z*(cid:5)zz
(3) (cid:5) (cid:4) .
z*(cid:5)z z(cid:5)z* (z*(cid:5)z)(z*(cid:5)z)
We then have

SEC. 18.5 Poisson’s Integral Formula for Potentials 779
We now write F(z) (cid:4) £(r, u)(cid:2)i°(r, u)and take the real part on both sides of (4). Then
we obtain Poisson’s integral formula2

This formula represents the harmonic function £in the disk ƒzƒ (cid:8)Rin terms of its values
£(R, a) on the boundary (the circle) ƒzƒ (cid:4)R.
Formula (5) is still valid if the boundary function £(R, a) is merely piecewise
continuous (as is practically often the case; see Figs. 405 and 406 in Sec. 18.2 for an
example). Then (5) gives a function harmonic in the open disk, and on the circle ƒzƒ (cid:4)R
equal to the given boundary function, except at points where the latter is discontinuous.
A proof can be found in Ref. [D1] in App. 1.
Series for Potentials in Disks
From (5) we may obtain an important series development of £in terms of simple harmonic
functions. We remember that the quotient in the integrand of (5) was derived from (3).
We claim that the right side of (3) is the real part of
z*(cid:2)z (z*(cid:2)z)(z*(cid:5)z) z*z*(cid:5)zz(cid:5)z*z(cid:2)zz*
(cid:4) (cid:4) .
z*(cid:5)z (z*(cid:5)z)(z*(cid:5)z) ƒz*(cid:5)zƒ2
Indeed, the last denominator is real and so is z*z*(cid:5)zz in the numerator, whereas
(cid:5)z*z (cid:2)zz*(cid:4)2i Im (zz*) in the numerator is pure imaginary. This verifies our claim.
Now by the use of the geometric series we obtain (develop the denominator)

General Properties of Harmonic Functions.
Uniqueness Theorem for the Dirichlet Problem
Recall from Sec. 10.8 that harmonic functions are solutions to Laplace’s equation and
their second-order partial derivatives are continuous. In this section we explore how
general properties of harmonic functions often can be obtained from properties of analytic
functions. This can frequently be done in a simple fashion. Specifically, important mean
value properties of harmonic functions follow readily from those of analytic functions.
The details are as follows.
THEOREM 1 Mean Value Property of Analytic Functions
LetF(z)be analytic in a simply connected domain D. Then the value of F(z)at a point
z in D is equal to the mean value of F(z)on any circle in D with center at z .

The right side is the mean value of Fon the circle ((cid:4)value of the integral divided by the

For harmonic functions, Theorem 1 implies
THEOREM 2 Two Mean Value Properties of Harmonic Functions
Let £(x, y)be harmonic in a simply connected domain D. Then the value of £(x, y)
at a point(x , y )in D is equal to the mean value of £(x, y)on any circle in D with
0 0
center at (x , y ). This value is also equal to the mean value of £(x, y) on any

Returning to analytic functions, we state and prove another famous consequence of Cauchy’s
integral formula. The proof is indirect and shows quite a nice idea of applying the ML-
inequality. (A bounded regionis a region that lies entirely in some circle about the origin.)
THEOREM 3 Maximum Modulus Theorem for Analytic Functions
Let F(z) be analytic and nonconstant in a domain containing a bounded region R
and its boundary. Then the absolute value ƒF(z)ƒ cannot have a maximum at an
interior point of R. Consequently, the maximum of ƒF(z)ƒ is taken on the boundary
of R. If F(z)(cid:6)0 in R, the same is true with respect to the minimum of ƒF(z)ƒ.
c18.qxd 11/2/10 6:55 PM Page 783
SEC. 18.6 General Properties of Harmonic Functions 783
PROOF We assume that ƒF(z)ƒ has a maximum at an interior point z of R and show that this
0
leads to a contradiction. Let ƒF(z )ƒ (cid:4)M be this maximum. Since F(z) is not constant,
0
ƒF(z)ƒ is not constant, as follows from Example 3 in Sec. 13.4. Consequently, we can find
a circle C of radius r with center at z such that the interior of C is in R and ƒF(z)ƒ is
0
smaller than M at some point P of C. Since ƒF(z)ƒ is continuous, it will be smaller than
M on an arc C of C that contains P (see Fig. 425), say,

We now apply the ML-inequality (Sec. 14.1) to (1) and note that ƒz(cid:5)z ƒ (cid:4)r. We then

that is, M(cid:7)M,which is impossible. Hence our assumption is false and the first statement
is proved.
Next we prove the second statement. If F(z) (cid:6)0 in R, then 1 F(z) is analytic in R.

From the statement already proved it follows that the maximum of 1 ƒF(z)ƒ lies on the

boundary of R. But this maximum corresponds to the minimum of ƒF(z)ƒ.This completes
the proof. (cid:2)

Fig. 425. Proof of Theorem 3
This theorem has several fundamental consequences for harmonic functions, as follows.
THEOREM 4 Harmonic Functions
Let£(x, y)be harmonic in a domain containing a simply connected bounded region
R and its boundary curve C. Then:
(I) (Maximum principle) If £(x, y) is not constant, it has neither a maximum
nor a minimum in R. Consequently, the maximum and the minimum are taken on
the boundary of R.
(II) If £(x, y) is constant on C, then £(x, y) is a constant.
(III) If h(x, y) is harmonic in R and on C and if h(x, y) (cid:4) £(x, y) on C, then
h(x, y)(cid:4) £(x, y) everywhere in R.
c18.qxd 11/2/10 6:55 PM Page 784
784 CHAP. 18 Complex Analysis and Potential Theory
PROOF (I) Let °(x, y) be a conjugate harmonic function of £(x, y) in R. Then the complex
function F(z)(cid:4) £(x, y)(cid:2)i°(x, y) is analytic in R, and so is G(z)(cid:4)eF(z). Its absolute
value is
ƒG(z)ƒ (cid:4)eRe F(z)(cid:4)e£(x, y).
From Theorem 3 it follows that ƒG(z)ƒ cannot have a maximum at an interior point of R.
Since e£ is a monotone increasing function of the real variable £, the statement about
the maximum of £ follows. From this, the statement about the minimum follows by
replacing £ by (cid:5)£.
(II) By (I) the function £(x, y) takes its maximum and its minimum on C. Thus, if
£(x, y) is constant on C, its minimum must equal its maximum, so that £(x, y) must be
a constant.
(III) If h and £ are harmonic in R and on C, then h(cid:5) £ is also harmonic in R and
on C, and by assumption, h(cid:5) £ (cid:4)0everywhere on C. By (II) we thus have h(cid:5) £ (cid:4)0
everywhere in R, and (III) is proved. (cid:2)
The last statement of Theorem 4 is very important. It means that a harmonic function is
uniquely determined in R by its values on the boundary of R.Usually, £(x, y)is required
to be harmonic in R and continuous on the boundary of R, that is,
lim £(x, y)(cid:4) £(x , y ), where (x , y ) is on the boundary and (x, y) is in R.
yx :: yx 00 0 0 0 0
Under these assumptions the maximum principle (I) is still applicable. The problem of
determining £(x, y)when the boundary values are given is called the Dirichlet problem
for the Laplace equation in two variables, as we know. From (III) we thus have, as a
highlight of our discussion,
THEOREM 5 Uniqueness Theorem for the Dirichlet Problem
If for a given region and given boundary values the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace
equation in two variables has a solution, the solution is unique.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Complex Analysis and Potential Theory
Potential theory is the theory of solutions of Laplace’s equation
(1) (cid:3)2£ (cid:4)0.
Solutions whose second partial derivatives are continuous are called harmonic
functions. Equation (1) is the most important PDE in physics, where it is of interest
in two and three dimensions. It appears in electrostatics (Sec. 18.1), steady-state
heat problems (Sec. 18.3), fluid flow (Sec. 18.4), gravity, etc. Whereas the three-
dimensional case requires other methods (see Chap. 12), two-dimensional potential
theory can be handled by complex analysis, since the real and imaginary parts of
an analytic function are harmonic (Sec. 13.4). They remain harmonic under
conformal mapping (Sec. 18.2), so that conformal mapping becomes a powerful
tool in solving boundary value problems for (1), as is illustrated in this chapter.
With a real potential £ in (1) we can associate a complex potential
(2) F(z) (cid:4) £ (cid:2)i° (Sec. 18.1).
Then both families of curves £ (cid:4)const and ° (cid:4)const have a physical meaning.
In electrostatics, they are equipotential lines and lines of electrical force (Sec. 18.1).
In heat problems, they are isotherms (curves of constant temperature) and lines of
heat flow (Sec. 18.3). In fluid flow, they are equipotential lines of the velocity
potential and streamlines (Sec. 18.4).
For the disk, the solution of the Dirichlet problem is given by the Poisson formula
(Sec. 18.5) or by a series that on the boundary circle becomes the Fourier series of
the given boundary values (Sec. 18.5).
Harmonic functions, like analytic functions, have a number of general properties;
particularly important are the mean value property and the maximum modulus
property (Sec. 18.6), which implies the uniqueness of the solution of the Dirichlet
problem (Theorem 5 in Sec. 18.6).

CHAPTER 21 Numerics for ODEs and PDEs
Numeric analysis or briefly numerics continues to be one of the fastest growing areas
of engineering mathematics. This is a natural trend with the ever greater availability of
computing power and global Internet use. Indeed, good software implementation of
numerical methods are readily available. Take a look at the updated list of Software
starting on p. 788. It contains software for purchase (commercial software) and software
for free download (public-domain software). For convenience, we provide Internet
addresses and phone numbers. The software list includes computer algebra systems
(CASs), such as Maple and Mathematica, along with the Maple Computer Guide, 10th
ed., and Mathematica Computer Guide, 10th ed., by E. Kreyszig and E. J. Norminton
related to this text that teach you stepwise how to use these computer algebra systems and
with complete engineering examples drawn from the text. Furthermore, there is scientific
software, such as IMSL,LAPACK (free download), and scientific calculators with graphic
capabilities such as TI-Nspire.Notethat, although we have listed frequently used quality
software, this list is by no means complete.
In your career as an engineer, appplied mathematician, or scientist you are likely to use
commercially available software or proprietary software, owned by the company you work
for, that uses numeric methods to solve engineering problems, such as modeling chemical or
biological processes, planning ecologically sound heating systems, or computing trajectories
of spacecraft or satellites. For example, one of the collaborators of this book (Herbert Kreyszig)
used proprietary software to determine the value of bonds, which amounted to solving higher
degree polynomial equations, using numeric methods discussed in Sec. 19.2.

788 PART E Numeric Analysis
However, the availability of quality software does not alleviate your effort and
responsibility to first understand these numerical methods. Your effort will pay off
because, with your mathematical expertise in numerics, you will be able to plan your
solution approach, judiciously select and use the appropriate software, judge the quality
of software, and, perhaps, even write your own numerics software.
Numerics extends your ability to solve problems that are either difficult or impossible
to solve analytically. For example, certain integrals such as error function [see App. 3,
formula (35)] or large eigenvalue problems that generate high-degree characteristic
polynomials cannot be solved analytically. Numerics is also used to construct approximating
polynomials through data points that were obtained from some experiments.
Part E is designed to give you a solid background in numerics. We present many numeric
methods as algorithms, which give these methods in detailed steps suitable for software
implementation on your computer, CAS, or programmable calculator. The first chapter,
Chap. 19,covers three main areas. These are general numerics (floating point, rounding errors,
etc.), solving equations of the form f(x)(cid:2)0 (using Newton’s method and other methods),
interpolation along with methods of numeric integration that make use of it, and differentiation.
Chapter 20 covers the essentials of numeric linear algebra. The chapter breaks into two
parts: solving linear systems of equations by methods of Gauss, Doolittle, Cholesky, etc.
and solving eigenvalue problems numerically. Chapter 21 again has two themes: solving
ordinary differential equations and systems of ordinary differential equations as well as
solving partial differential equations.
Numerics is a very active area of research as new methods are invented, existing methods
improved and adapted, and old methods—impractical in precomputer times—are
rediscovered. A main goal in these activities is the development of well-structured
software. And in large-scale work—millions of equations or steps of iterations—even
small algorithmic improvements may have a large significant effect on computing time,
storage demand, accuracy, and stability.
Remark on Software Use.Part E is designed in such a way as to allow compelete flexibility
on the use of CASs, software, or graphing calculators. The computational requirements
range from very little use to heavy use. The choice of computer use is at the discretion
of the professor. The material and problem sets (except where clearly indicated such as
in CAS Projects, CAS Problems, or CAS Experiments, which can be omitted without loss
of continuity) do not require the use of a CAS or software. A scientific calculator perhaps
with graphing capabilities is all that is required.

Numerics in General
Numeric analysis or briefly numerics has a distinct flavor that is different from basic
calculus, from solving ODEs algebraically, or from other (nonnumeric) areas. Whereas in
calculus and in ODEs there were very few choices on how to solve the problem and your
answer was an algebraic answer, in numerics you have many more choices and your
answers are given as tables of values (numbers) or graphs. You have to make judicous
choices as to what numeric method or algorithm you want to use, how accurate you need
your result to be, with what value (starting value) do you want to begin your computation,
and others. This chapter is designed to provide a good transition from the algebraic type
of mathematics to the numeric type of mathematics.
We begin with the general concepts such as floating point, roundoff errors, and general
numeric errors and their propagation. This is followed in Sec. 19.2 by the important topic
of solving equations of the type f(x)(cid:2)0by various numeric methods, including the famous
Newton method. Section 19.3 introduces interpolation methods. These are methods that
construct new (unknown) function values from known function values. The knowledge
gained in Sec. 19.3 is applied to spline interpolation (Sec. 19.4) and is useful for under-
standing numeric integration and differentiation covered in the last section.
Numerics provides an invaluable extension to the knowledge base of the problem-
solving engineer. Many problems have no solution formula (think of a complicated integral
or a polynomial of high degree or the interpolation of values obtained by measurements).
In other cases a complicated solution formula may exist but may be practically useless.
It is for these kinds of problems that a numerical method may generate a good answer.
Thus, it is very important that the applied mathematician, engineer, physicist, or scientist
becomes familiar with the essentials of numerics and its ideas, such as estimation of errors,
order of convergence, numerical methods expressed in algorithms, and is also informed
about the important numeric methods.

Introduction
As an engineer or physicist you may deal with problems in elasticity and need to solve
an equation such as x cosh x (cid:2)1 or a more difficult problem of finding the roots of a
higher order polynomial. Or you encounter an integral such as

SEC. 19.1 Introduction 791
[see App. 3, formula (35)] that you cannot solve by elementary calculus. Such problems,
which are difficult or impossible to solve algebraically, arise frequently in applications.
They call for numeric methods, that is, systematic methods that are suitable for solving,
numerically, the problems on computers or calculators. Such solutions result in tables of
numbers, graphical representation (figures), or both. Typical numeric methods are iterative
in nature and, for a well-choosen problem and a good starting value, will frequently
converge to a desired answer. The evolution from a given problem that you observed in
an experimental lab or in an industrial setting (in engineering, physics, biology, chemistry,
economics, etc.) to an approximation suitable for numerics to a final answer usually
requires the following steps.
1. Modeling. We set up a mathematical model of our problem, such as an integral, a
system of equations, or a differential equation.
2. Choosing a numeric method and parameters (e.g., step size), perhaps with a
preliminary error estimation.
3. Programming. We use the algorithm to write a corresponding program in a CAS,
(cid:3)(cid:3)
such as Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, or Mathcad, or, say, in Java, C or C , or
FORTRAN, selecting suitable routines from a software system as needed.
4. Doing the computation.
5. Interpreting the resultsin physical or other terms, also deciding to rerun if further
results are needed.
Steps 1 and 2 are related. A slight change of the model may often admit of a more efficient
method. To choose methods, we must first get to know them. Chapters 19–21 contain efficient
algorithms for the most important classes of problems occurring frequently in practice.
In Step 3 the program consists of the given data and a sequence of instructions to be
executed by the computer in a certain order for producing the answer in numeric or graphic
form.
To create a good understanding of the nature of numeric work, we continue in this
section with some simple general remarks.
Floating-Point Form of Numbers
We know that in decimal notation, every real number is represented by a finite or an
infinite sequence of decimal digits. Now most computers have two ways of representing
numbers, called fixed point and floating point. In a fixed-point system all numbers are
given with a fixed number of decimals after the decimal point; for example, numbers
given with 3 decimals are 62.358, 0.014, 1.000. In a text we would write, say, 3 decimals
as 3D. Fixed-point representations are impractical in most scientific computations because
of their limited range (explain!) and will not concern us.
In a floating-point system we write, for instance,
0.6247(cid:2)103, 0.1735(cid:2)10(cid:3)13, (cid:4)0.2000(cid:2)10(cid:3)1
or sometimes also
6.247(cid:2)102, 1.735(cid:2)10(cid:3)14, (cid:4)2.000(cid:2)10(cid:3)2.
We see that in this system the number of significant digits is kept fixed, whereas the decimal
point is “floating.” Here, a significant digit of a number c is any given digit of c, except
c19-a.qxd 11/2/10 8:20 PM Page 792
792 CHAP. 19 Numerics in General
possibly for zeros to the left of the first nonzero digit; these zeros serve only to fix the
position of the decimal point. (Thus any other zero is a significant digit of c.) For instance,
13600, 1.3600, 0.0013600
all have 5 significant digits. In a text we indicate, say, 5 significant digits, by 5S.
The use of exponents permits us to represent very large and very small numbers. Indeed,
theoretically any nonzero number a can be written as
(1) a(cid:2)(cid:7)m(cid:2)10n, 0.1(cid:8) ƒmƒ (cid:9)1, n integer.
On modern computers, which use binary (base 2) numbers, mis limited to kbinary digits (e.g.,
k(cid:2)8)and nis limited (see below), giving representations (for finitely many numbers only!)
(2) a(cid:2)(cid:7)m(cid:2)2n, m(cid:2)0.d d Á d , d (cid:6)0.
1 2 k 1
These numbers a are called k-digit binary machine numbers. Their fractional part m
(orm)is called the mantissa.This is not identical with “mantissa” as used for logarithms.
n is called the exponent of a.
It is important to realize that there are only finitely many machine numbers and that
they become less and less “dense” with increasing a. For instance, there are as many
numbers between 2 and 4 as there are between 1024 and 2048. Why?
The smallest positive machine number eps with 1(cid:3)eps (cid:6)1 is called the machine
accuracy. It is important to realize that there are no numbers in the intervals [1, 1 (cid:3)eps],
[2, 2
(cid:3)2(cid:2)eps],Á
, [1024,
1024(cid:3)1024(cid:2)eps],Á
.This means that, if the mathematical
answer to a computation would be 1024(cid:3)1024(cid:2)eps 2,the computer result will be either
>
1024 or 1024(cid:2)epsso it is impossible to achieve greater accuracy.
Underflow and Overflow. The range of exponents that a typical computer can handle
is very large. The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) floating-point
standard for single precisionis from 2(cid:3)126to 2128 (1.175(cid:5)10(cid:3)38 to 3.403(cid:5)1038)and
for double precision it is from 2(cid:3)1022 to 21024 (2.225(cid:5)10(cid:3)308 to 1.798(cid:5)10308).
As a minor technicality, to avoid storing a minus in the exponent, the ranges are shifted
from [(cid:4)126, 128]by adding 126 (for double precision 1022). Note that shifted exponents
of 255 and 1047 are used for some special cases such as representing infinity.
If, in a computation a number outside that range occurs, this is called underflowwhen
the number is smaller and overflowwhen it is larger. In the case of underflow, the result
is usually set to zero and computation continues. Overflow might cause the computer to
halt. Standard codes (by IMSL, NAG, etc.) are written to avoid overflow. Error messages
on overflow may then indicate programming errors (incorrect input data, etc.). From here
on, we will be discussing the decimal results that we obtain from our computations.
Roundoff
An error is caused by chopping((cid:2)discarding all digits from some decimal on) or rounding.
This error is called roundoff error, regardless of whether we chop or round. The rule for
rounding off a number to kdecimals is as follows. (The rule for rounding off to ksignificant
digits is the same, with “decimal” replaced by “significant digit.”)
Roundoff Rule. To round a number xto kdecimals, and
5(cid:2)10(cid:3)(k(cid:3)1)to
x and chop the
digits after the (k(cid:3)1)st digit.
c19-a.qxd 11/2/10 8:20 PM Page 793
SEC. 19.1 Introduction 793
EXAMPLE 1 Roundoff Rule
Round the number 1.23454621 to (a)2 decimals, (b)3 decimals, (c)4 decimals, (d)5 decimals, and (e)6 decimals.
Solution. (a) For 2 decimals we add 5(cid:2)10(cid:3)(k(cid:3)1)(cid:2)5(cid:2)10(cid:3)3(cid:2)0.005 to the given number, that is,
1.2345621(cid:3)0.005(cid:2)1.23 954621. Then we chop off the digits “954621” after the space or equivalently
1.23954621(cid:4)0.00954621(cid:2)1.23.
(b) 1.23454621(cid:3)0.0005(cid:2)1.235 04621,so that for 3 decimals we get 1.234.
(c) 1.23459621 after chopping give us 1.2345 (4 decimals).
(d) 1.23455121 yields 1.23455 (5 decimals).
(e) 1.23454671 yields 1.234546 (6 decimals).
(cid:2)
Can you round the number to 7 decimals?
Chopping is not recommended because the corresponding error can be larger than that
in rounding. (Nevertheless, some computers use it because it is simpler and faster. On the
other hand, some computers and calculators improve accuracy of results by doing
intermediate calculations using one or more extra digits, called guarding digits.)
Error in Rounding. Let a(cid:2)fl(a)in (2) be the floating-point computer approximation of
a in (1) obtained by rounding, where fl suggests floating. Then the roundoff rule gives (by
dropping exponents) ƒm(cid:4)mƒ (cid:8)1 (cid:2)10(cid:3)k.Since ƒmƒ (cid:11)0.1,this implies (when a(cid:10)0)
2
a(cid:4)a m(cid:4)m 1
(3) (cid:3) (cid:8) (cid:2)101(cid:3)k.
` a ` ` m ` 2
The right side u(cid:2)1 (cid:2)101(cid:3)k is called the rounding unit. If we write a(cid:2)a(1 (cid:3)d), we
2
have by algebra (a(cid:4)a) a(cid:2)d,hence ƒdƒ (cid:8)uby (3). This shows that the rounding unit
>
u is an error bound in rounding.
Rounding errors may ruin a computation completely, even a small computation. In
general, these errors become the more dangerous the more arithmetic operations (perhaps
several millions!) we have to perform. It is therefore important to analyze computational
programs for expected rounding errors and to find an arrangement of the computations
such that the effect of rounding errors is as small as possible.
As mentioned, the arithmetic in a computer is not exact and causes further errors;
however, these will not be relevant to our discussion.
Accuracy in Tables. Although available software has rendered various tables of function
values superfluous, some tables (of higher functions, of coefficients of integration
formulas, etc.) will still remain in occasional use. If a table shows k significant digits, it
(cid:2)
is conventionally assumed that any value a in the table deviates from the exact value a
by at most (cid:7)1 unit of the kth digit.
2
Loss of Significant Digits
This means that a result of a calculation has fewer correct digits than the numbers from
which it was obtained. This happens if we subtract two numbers of about the same size,
for example, 0.1439(cid:4)0.1426 (“subtractive cancellation”). It may occur in simple
problems, but it can be avoided in most cases by simple changes of the algorithm—if one
is aware of it! Let us illustrate this with the following basic problem.
EXAMPLE 2 Quadratic Equation. Loss of Significant Digits
Find the roots of the equation
x2(cid:3)40x(cid:3)2(cid:2)0,

Errors of Numeric Results
Final results of computations of unknown quantities generally are approximations; that
is, they are not exact but involve errors. Such an error may result from a combination
of the following effects. Roundoff errors result from rounding, as discussed above.
Experimental errors are errors of given data (probably arising from measurements).
Truncating errors result from truncating (prematurely breaking off), for instance, if we
replace a Taylor series with the sum of its first few terms. These errors depend on the
computational method used and must be dealt with individually for each method.
[“Truncating” is sometimes used as a term for chopping off (see before), a terminology
that is not recommended.]

Formulas for Errors. If a is an approximate value of a quantity whose exact value is

the error of a. Hence

For instance, if (cid:2) a (cid:2)10.5 is an approximation of a(cid:2)10.2, its error is P(cid:2)(cid:4)0.3. The
error of an approximation (cid:2) a (cid:2)1.60 of a(cid:2)1.82 is P(cid:2)0.22.
CAUTION! In the literature ƒa(cid:4)(cid:2) aƒ (“absolute error”) or (cid:2) a (cid:4)a are sometimes also
used as definitions of error.

This still looks problematic because P is unknown—if it were known, we could get
a(cid:2)(cid:2) a (cid:3)Pfrom (6) and we would be done. But what one often can obtain in practice is
(cid:2)
an error bound for a, that is, a number b such that
ƒPƒ (cid:8)b, hence ƒa(cid:4)(cid:2) aƒ (cid:8)b.

This tells us how far away from our computed a the unknown acan at most lie. Similarly,
for the relative error, an error bound is a number b such that

Error Propagation
This is an important matter. It refers to how errors at the beginning and in later steps
(roundoff, for example) propagate into the computation and affect accuracy, sometimes
very drastically. We state here what happens to error bounds. Namely, bounds for the
erroradd under addition and subtraction, whereas bounds for the relative erroradd under
multiplication and division. You do well to keep this in mind.
THEOREM 1 Error Propagation
(a) In addition and subtraction, a bound for the error of the results is given by
the sum of the error bounds for the terms.
(b) In multiplication and division, an error bound for the relative error of the
results is given (approximately) by the sum of the bounds for the relative errors
of the given numbers.
PROOF (a) We use the notations x(cid:2)(cid:2) x (cid:3)P , y(cid:2)(cid:2) y (cid:3)P , ƒP ƒ (cid:8)b , ƒP ƒ (cid:8)b . Then for the

Every numeric method should be accompanied by an error estimate. If such a formula is
lacking, is extremely complicated, or is impractical because it involves information (for
instance, on derivatives) that is not available, the following may help.

Algorithm. Stability
Numeric methods can be formulated as algorithms. An algorithm is a step-by-step
procedure that states a numeric method in a form (a “pseudocode”) understandable to
humans. (See Table 19.1 to see what an algorithm looks like.) The algorithm is then used
to write a program in a programming language that the computer can understand so that
it can execute the numeric method. Important algorithms follow in the next sections. For
routine tasks your CAS or some other software system may contain programs that you
can use or include as parts of larger programs of your own.
Stability. To be useful, an algorithm should be stable; that is, small changes in the initial
data should cause only small changes in the final results. However, if small changes in the
initial data can produce large changes in the final results, we call the algorithm unstable.
This “numeric instability,” which in most cases can be avoided by choosing a better
algorithm, must be distinguished from “mathematical instability” of a problem, which is
called “ill-conditioning,” a concept we discuss in the next section.
Some algorithms are stable only for certain initial data, so that one must be careful in
such a case.

Solution of Equations by Iteration
For each of the remaining sections of this chapter, we select basic kinds of problems and
discuss numeric methods on how to solve them. The reader will learn about a variety of
important problems and become familiar with ways of thinking in numerical analysis.
Perhaps the easiest conceptual problem is to find solutions of a single equation
(1) f(x) (cid:2)0,
where fis a given function. A solutionof (1) is a number x(cid:2)ssuch that f(s)(cid:2)0.Here,
s suggests “solution,” but we shall also use other letters.
It is interesting to note that the task of solving (1) is a question made for numeric
algorithms, as in general there are no direct formulas, except in a few simple cases.
Examples of single equations are x3(cid:3)x(cid:2)1, sin x(cid:2)0.5x, tan x (cid:2)x, cosh x (cid:2)sec x,
cosh x cos x (cid:2)(cid:4)1,which can all be written in the form of (1). The first of the five equations
is an algebraic equation because the corresponding f is a polynomial. In this case the
solutions are called rootsof the equation and the solution process is called finding roots.The
other equations are transcendental equationsbecause they involve transcendental functions.
There are a very large number of applications in engineering, where we have to solve a
single equation (1). You have seen such applications when solving characteristic equations
in Chaps. 2, 4, and 8; partial fractions in Chap. 6; residue integration in Chap. 16, finding
eigenvalues in Chap. 12, and finding zeros of Bessel functions, also in Chap. 12. Moreover,
methods of finding roots are very important in areas outside of classical engineering. For
example, in finance, the problem of determining how much a bond is worth amounts to
solving an algebraic equation.
To solve (1) when there is no formula for the exact solution available, we can use an
approximation method, such as an iteration method.This is a method in which we start from
an initial guess x (which may be poor) and compute step by step (in general better and better)
0
Á
approximations x , x , of an unknown solution of (1). We discuss three such methods that
1 2
are of particular practical importance and mention two others in the problem set.
It is very important that the reader understand these methods and their underlying ideas.
The reader will then be able to select judiciously the appropriate software from among
different software packages that employ variations of such methods and not just treat the
software programs as “black boxes.”
In general, iteration methods are easy to program because the computational operations
are the same in each step—just the data change from step to step—and, more importantly,
if in a concrete case a method converges, it is stable in general (see Sec. 19.1).

Fixed-Point Iteration for Solving Equations f(x) 0
Note: Our present use of the word “fixed point” has absolutely nothing to do with that in
the last section.
By some algebraic steps we transform (1) into the form
(2) x(cid:2)g(x).
Then we choose an x and compute x (cid:2)g(x ), x (cid:2)g(x ), and in general

SEC. 19.2 Solution of Equations by Iteration 799
A solution of (2) is called a fixed pointof g, motivating the name of the method. This is a
solution of (1), since from x(cid:2)g(x)we can return to the original form f(x)(cid:2) 0.From (1)
we may get several different forms of (2). The behavior of corresponding iterative sequences
Á
x , x , may differ, in particular, with respect to their speed of convergence. Indeed, some
0 1
of them may not converge at all. Let us illustrate these facts with a simple example.
EXAMPLE 1 An Iteration Process (Fixed-Point Iteration)
Set up an iteration process for the equation f(x)(cid:2)x2(cid:4)3x(cid:3)1(cid:2)0. Since we know the solutions
x(cid:2)1.5 (cid:7) 11.25, thus 2.618034 and 0.381966,
we can watch the behavior of the error as the iteration proceeds.
Solution. The equation may be written
(4a) x(cid:2)g 1(x)(cid:2)1
3
(x2(cid:3)1), thus x n(cid:3)1(cid:2)1
3
(x n2(cid:3)1).
If we choose x (cid:2)1,we obtain the sequence (Fig. 426a; computed with 6S and then rounded)
0

which seems to approach the smaller solution. If we choose x (cid:2)2,the situation is similar. If we choose

x (cid:2)3,we obtain the sequence (Fig. 426a, upper part)

Our figures show the following. In the lower part of Fig. 426a the slope of g(x)is less than the slope of y(cid:2)x,
1
which is 1, thus ƒgr (x)ƒ (cid:9)1,and we seem to have convergence. In the upper part, g(x)is steeper (gr (x)(cid:6)1)
1 1 1
and we have divergence. In Fig. 426b the slope of g(x)is less near the intersection point (x(cid:2)2.618,fixed
2
point of g, solution of f(x)(cid:2)0), and both sequences seem to converge. From all this we conclude that
2
convergence seems to depend on the fact that, in a neighborhood of a solution, the curve of g(x)is less steep
than the straight line y(cid:2)x,and we shall now see that this condition ƒgr (x)ƒ (cid:9)1 ((cid:2)slope of y(cid:2)x)is sufficient
(cid:2)
for convergence.
An iteration process defined by (3) is called convergent for an x if the corresponding
0
Á
sequence x , x , is convergent.
0 1
A sufficient condition for convergence is given in the following theorem, which has
various practical applications.
THEOREM 1 Convergence of Fixed-Point Iteration
Let x(cid:2)sbe a solution of x(cid:2)g(x)and suppose that g has a continuous derivative
in some interval J containing s. Then, if ƒgr (x)ƒ (cid:8)K(cid:9)1in J, the iteration process
defined by (3) converges for any x in J. The limit of the sequence {x } is s.
0 n
PROOF By the mean value theorem of differential calculus there is a t between x and s such that
g(x)(cid:4)g(s) (cid:2)gr (t)(x(cid:4)s) (x in J).
Since g(s)(cid:2)sand x (cid:2)g(x ), x (cid:2)g(x ),Á ,we obtain from this and the condition on

ƒgr (x)ƒ in the theorem

Applying this inequality n times, for n,

Since K(cid:9)1, we have Kn:0; hence ƒx (cid:4)sƒ :0 as n:(cid:12). (cid:2)

We mention that a function gsatisfying the condition in Theorem 1 is called a contraction
because ƒg(x)(cid:4)g(v)ƒ (cid:8)Kƒx(cid:4)vƒ, where K(cid:9)1. Furthermore, K gives information on
the speed of convergence. For instance, if K(cid:2)0.5,then the accuracy increases by at least
2 digits in only 7 steps because 0.57(cid:9)0.01.

Newton’s Method for Solving Equations f(x) 0
Newton’s method, also known as Newton–Raphson’s method,1 is another iteration
method for solving equations f(x)(cid:2)0,where fis assumed to have a continuous derivative fr .
The method is commonly used because of its simplicity and great speed.
The underlying idea is that we approximate the graph of f by suitable tangents. Using
an approximate value x obtained from the graph of f, we let x be the point of intersection
0 1
of the x-axis and the tangent to the curve of f at x (see Fig. 428). Then

The inequality in line 4 is a termination criterion. If the sequence of the x converges

a form of the relative error test. It ensures that the result has the desired number of significant

Order of an Iteration Method.
Speed of Convergence
The quality of an iteration method may be characterized by the speed of convergence, as
follows.
Let x (cid:2)g(x ) define an iteration method, and let x approximate a solution s of
n(cid:3)1 n n
x(cid:2)g(x).Then x (cid:2)s(cid:4)P ,where P is the error of x .Suppose that gis differentiable
n n n n
a number of times, so that the Taylor formula gives
x (cid:2)g(x )(cid:2)g(s)(cid:3)gr (s)(x (cid:4)s) (cid:3)1gs (s)(x (cid:4)s)2(cid:3) Á
n(cid:3)1 n n 2 n
(6)
(cid:2)g(s) (cid:4)gr (s)P (cid:3)1gs (s)P2 (cid:3) Á .
n 2 n
The exponent of P in the first nonvanishing term after g(s) is called the order of the
n
iteration process defined by g. The order measures the speed of convergence.
To see this, subtract g(s) (cid:2)son both sides of (6). Then on the left you get x (cid:4)s(cid:2)
n(cid:3)1
(cid:4)P ,where P is the error of x . And on the right the remaining expression equals
n(cid:3)1 n(cid:3)1 n(cid:3)1
approximately its first nonzero term because ƒP ƒ is small in the case of convergence.
n
Thus
(a) P (cid:3)(cid:3)gr (s)P in the case of first order,
n(cid:3)1 n
(7)
(b) P (cid:3)(cid:4)1gs (s)P2 in the case of second order, etc.
n(cid:3)1 2 n
Thus if P (cid:2)10(cid:3)kin some step, then for second order, P (cid:2)c(cid:2) (10(cid:3)k)2(cid:2)c(cid:2)10(cid:3)2k,
n n(cid:3)1
so that the number of significant digits is about doubled in each step.

solution to 5D-accuracy. This is an a priori estimateor prior estimatebecause we can compute it after only
one iteration, prior to further iterations.

where M(cid:2)2n(cid:3)2n(cid:3)1(cid:3) Á (cid:3)2(cid:3)1(cid:2)2n(cid:3)1(cid:4)1. We show below that P (cid:3)(cid:4)0.11. Consequently, our

Hence n(cid:2)2is the smallest possible n, according to this crude estimate, in good agreement with Example 4.

Difficulties in Newton’s Method. Difficulties may arise if ƒfr (x)ƒ is very small near a
solution sof f(x)(cid:2)0.For instance, let sbe a zero of f(x)of second or higher order. Then
Newton’s method converges only linearly, as is shown by an application of l’Hopital’s rule
to (8). Geometrically, small ƒfr (x)ƒ means that the tangent of f(x) near salmost coincides
r
with the x-axis (so that double precision may be needed to get f(x) and f (x) accurately
enough). Then for values
x(cid:2)(cid:2)
s far away from swe can still have small function values
R((cid:2) s)(cid:2)f((cid:2)
s).
In this case we call the equation f(x)(cid:2)0 ill-conditioned. R((cid:2) s) is called the residual of
f(x)(cid:2)0 at (cid:2) s. Thus a small residu al guarantees a small error of (cid:2) s only if the equation is
not ill-conditioned.
EXAMPLE 7 An Ill-Conditioned Equation
f(x)(cid:2)x5(cid:3)10(cid:3)4x(cid:2)0is ill-conditioned, x(cid:2)0is a solution. fr (0)(cid:2)10(cid:3)4is small. At (cid:2) s (cid:2)0.1the residual
f(0.1)(cid:2)2(cid:2)10(cid:3)5is small, but the error (cid:4)0.1is larger in absolute value by a factor 5000. Invent a more drastic

Secant Method for Solving f(x) 0

Newton’s method is very powerful but has the disadvantage that the derivative f may

Interpolation
Á
We are given the values of a function f(x) at different points x , x , , x . We want to
0 1 n
find approximate values of the function f(x) for “new” x’s that lie between these points
for which the function values are given. This process is called interpolation. The student
should pay close attention to this section as interpolation forms the underlying foundation
for both Secs. 19.4 and 19.5. Indeed, interpolation allows us to develop formulas for
numeric integration and differentiation as shown in Sec. 19.5.
Continuing our discussion, we write these given values of a function f in the form
f (cid:2)f(x ), f (cid:2)f(x ), Á , f (cid:2)f(x )
0 0 1 1 n n
or as ordered pairs
(x , f ), (x , f ),
Á
, (x , f ).
0 0 1 1 n n
Where do these given function values come from? They may come from a “mathematical”
function, such as a logarithm or a Bessel function. More frequently, they may be measured
or automatically recorded values of an “empirical” function, such as air resistance of a
car or an airplane at different speeds. Other examples of functions that are “empirical”
are the yield of a chemical process at different temperatures or the size of the U.S.
population as it appears from censuses taken at 10-year intervals.
A standard idea in interpolation now is to find a polynomial p (x)of degree n(or less)
n
that assumes the given values; thus
(1) p (x )(cid:2)f , p (x )(cid:2)f , Á , p (x )(cid:2)f .
n 0 0 n 1 1 n n n
Á
We call this p an interpolation polynomial and x , , x the nodes. And if f(x) is a
n 0 n
mathematical function, we call p an approximationof f(or a polynomial approximation,
n
because there are other kinds of approximations, as we shall see later). We use p to get
n
(approximate) values of ffor x’s between x and x (“interpolation”) or sometimes outside
0 n
this interval x (cid:8)x(cid:8)x (“extrapolation”).

SEC. 19.3 Interpolation 809
Motivation. Polynomials are convenient to work with because we can readily differentiate
and integrate them, again obtaining polynomials. Moreover, they approximate continuous
functions with any desired accuracy. That is, for any continuous f(x) on an interval
J: a (cid:8)x(cid:8)b and error bound b(cid:6)0, there is a polynomial p (x) (of sufficiently high
n
degree n) such that
ƒf(x)(cid:4)p (x)ƒ (cid:9)b for all x on J.
n
This is the famous Weierstrass approximation theorem(for a proof see Ref. [GenRef7],
App. 1).
Existence and Uniqueness. Note that the interpolation polynomial p satisfying (1) for
n
given data exists and we shall give formulas for it below. Furthermore, p is unique:
n
Indeed, if another polynomial q also satisfies q (x )(cid:2)f ,Á , q (x )(cid:2)f , then
n n 0 0 n n n
p (x)(cid:4)q (x)(cid:2)0at x ,Á , x ,but a polynomial p (cid:4)q of degree n(or less) with n(cid:3)1
n n 0 n n n
roots must be identically zero, as we know from algebra; thus p (x)(cid:2)q (x)for all x, which
n n
means uniqueness. (cid:2)
How Do We Find p ? We shall explain several standard methods that give us p . By
n n
the uniqueness proof above, we know that, for given data, the different methods mustgive
us the same polynomial. However, the polynomials may be expressed in different forms
suitable for different purposes.
Lagrange Interpolation
Á
Given (x , f ), (x , f ), , (x , f ) with arbitrarily spaced x , Lagrange had the idea of
0 0 1 1 n n j
multiplying each f by a polynomial that is 1 at x and 0 at the other n nodes and then
j j
taking the sum of these n(cid:3)1 polynomials. Clearly, this gives the unique interpolation
polynomial of degree n or less. Beginning with the simplest case, let us see how this
works.
Linear interpolationis interpolation by the straight line through (x , f ), (x , f );see
0 0 1 1
Fig. 431. Thus the linear Lagrange polynomial p is a sum p (cid:2)L f (cid:3)L f with L

Error Estimate. If f is itself a polynomial of degree n (or less), it must coincide
with p because the n(cid:3)1 data (x , f ),Á , (x , f ) determine a polynomial uniquely,
n 0 0 n n
so the error is zero. Now the special f has its (n(cid:3)1)st derivative identically zero. This
makes it plausible that for a generalfits (n(cid:3)1)st derivative f(n(cid:3)1)should measurethe
error

It can be shown that this is true if

Thus ƒP (x)ƒ is 0 at the nodes and small near them, because of continuity. The product

And interpolation at an x will be best if we choose nodes on both sides of that x. Also,
we get error bounds by taking the smallest and the largest value of

THEOREM 1 Error of Interpolation
Formula (5) gives the error for any polynomial interpolation method if f(x) has a
continuous (n(cid:3)1)st derivative.
Practical error estimate.If the derivative in (5) is difficult or impossible to obtain, apply
the Error Principle (Sec. 19.1), that is, take another node and the Lagrange polynomial
p (x) and regard p (x)(cid:4)p (x) as a (crude) error estimate for p (x).

But the error 0.0004 in Example 1 disagrees, and we can learn something! Repetition of the computation there
with 5D instead of 4D gives
ln 9.2(cid:3)p (9.2)(cid:2)0.6(cid:2)2.19722(cid:3)0.4(cid:2)2.25129(cid:2)2.21885

with an actual error P(cid:2)2.21920(cid:4)2.21885(cid:2)0.00035, which lies nicely near the middle between our two
error bounds.
This shows that the discrepancy (0.0004 vs. 0.00035) was caused by rounding, which is not taken into account
in (5).
(B) Estimation by the Error Principle. We calculate p (9.2)(cid:2)2.21885 as before and then p (9.2) as in
1 2
Example 2 but with 5D, obtaining
p (9.2)(cid:2)0.54(cid:2)2.19722(cid:3)0.48(cid:2)2.25129(cid:4)0.02(cid:2)2.39790(cid:2)2.21916.

The difference p (9.2)(cid:4)p (9.2)(cid:2)0.00031is the approximate error of p (9.2)that we wanted to obtain; this
2 1 1 (cid:2)
is an approximation of the actual error 0.00035 given above.
Newton’s Divided Difference Interpolation
Á
For given data (x , f ), , (x , f ) the interpolation polynomial p (x) satisfying (1) is
0 0 n n n
unique, as we have shown. But for different purposes we may use p (x)in different forms.
n
Lagrange’s formjust discussed is useful for deriving formulas in numeric differentiation
(approximation formulas for derivatives) and integration (Sec. 19.5).
Practically more important are Newton’s forms of p (x),which we shall also use for solving
n
ODEs (in Sec. 21.2). They involve fewer arithmetic operations than Lagrange’s form.
Moreover, it often happens that we have to increase the degree nto reach a required accuracy.
Then in Newton’s forms we can use all the previous work and just add another term, a
possibility without counterpart for Lagrange’s form. This also simplifies the application of
the Error Principle (used in Example 3 for Lagrange). The details of these ideas are as follows.
Let p (x) be the (n(cid:4)1)st Newton polynomial (whose form we shall determine);
n(cid:3)1
thus p (x )(cid:2)f , p (x )(cid:2)f ,Á , p (x )(cid:2)f .Furthermore, let us write the
n(cid:3)1 0 0 n(cid:3)1 1 1 n(cid:3)1 n(cid:3)1 n(cid:3)1
nth Newton polynomial as
(6) p (x) (cid:2)p (x)(cid:3)g (x);

Here g (x) is to be determined so that p (x )(cid:2)f , p (x )(cid:2)f ,Á , p (x )(cid:2)f .

Since p and p agree at x , , x , we see that g is zero there. Also, g will
n n(cid:3)1 0 n(cid:3)1 n n
generally be a polynomial of nth degree because so is p ,whereas p can be of degree

n(cid:4)1 at most. Hence g must be of the form
n
(6s ) g (x)(cid:2)a (x(cid:4)x )(x(cid:4)x )Á (x(cid:4)x ).
n n 0 1 n(cid:3)1

Equal Spacing: Newton’s Forward Difference Formula
Newton’s formula (10) is valid for arbitrarily spacednodes as they may occur in practice in
experiments or observations. However, in many applications the x ’s are regularly spaced—
j
for instance, in measurements taken at regular intervals of time. Then, denoting the distance
by h, we can write
(11) x , x (cid:2)x (cid:3)h, x (cid:2)x (cid:3)2h, Á , x (cid:2)x (cid:3)nh.
0 1 0 2 0 n 0
We show how (8) and (10) now simplify considerably!
To get started, let us define the first forward difference of f at x by
j
¢f (cid:2)f (cid:4)f,
j j(cid:3)1 j
the second forward difference of f at x by
j
¢2f (cid:2) ¢f (cid:4) ¢f,
j j(cid:3)1 j
and, continuing in this way, the kth forward difference of f at x by
j
(12) ¢kf (cid:2) ¢k(cid:3)1f (cid:4) ¢k(cid:3)1f (k(cid:2)1, 2,Á ).

Examples and an explanation of the name “forward” follow on the next page. What is the
point of this? We show that if we have regular spacing (11), then
(13) f[x ,Á , x ](cid:2) 1 ¢kf .

1 0
Assuming (13) to be true for all forward differences of order k, we show that (13) holds for
k(cid:3)1. We use (8) with k(cid:3)1 instead of k; then we use (k(cid:3)1)h(cid:2)x (cid:4)x , resulting
k(cid:3)1 0
from (11), and finally (12) with j(cid:2)0,that is, ¢k(cid:3)1f (cid:2) ¢kf (cid:4) ¢kf .This gives
0 1 0

Formula (16) is an exact formula for the error, but it involves the unknown t. In
Example 5 (below) we show how to use (16) for obtaining an error estimate and an
interval in which the true value of f(x) must lie.
Comments on Accuracy. (A) The order of magnitude of the error P (x) is about equal
n
to that of the next difference not used in p (x).

(B) One should choose x , , x such that the x at which one interpolates is as well

centered between x , , x as possible.

The reason for (A) is that in (16),

fn(cid:3)1(t)(cid:3) hn(cid:3)1 , 1(cid:2)2Á (n(cid:3)1) (cid:8) 1 if ƒrƒ (cid:8) 1
(and actually for any r as long as we do not extrapolate). The reason for (B) is that
ƒr(r(cid:4)1) Á (r(cid:4)n)ƒ becomes smallest for that choice.

Numeric values are

The exact 6D-value is cosh 0.56(cid:2)1.160941.It lies within these bounds. Such bounds are not always so tight.
(cid:2)
Also, we did not consider roundoff errors, which will depend on the number of operations.
This example also explains the name “forward difference formula”: we see that the
differences in the formula slope forward in the difference table.
Equal Spacing: Newton’s Backward Difference Formula
Instead of forward-sloping differences we may also employ backward-sloping differ-
ences. The difference table remains the same as before (same numbers, in the same
positions), except for a very harmless change of the running subscript j(which we explain
in Example 6, below). Nevertheless, purely for reasons of convenience it is standard to
introduce a second name and notation for differences as follows. We define the first
backward difference of f at x by
j
(cid:15)f (cid:2)f (cid:4)f ,
j j j(cid:3)1
the second backward difference of f at x by
j
(cid:15)2f (cid:2)(cid:15)f (cid:4)(cid:15)f ,
j j j(cid:3)1
and, continuing in this way, the kth backward difference of f at x by
j
(17) (cid:15)kf (cid:2)(cid:15)k(cid:3)1 f (cid:4)(cid:15)k(cid:3)1 f (k(cid:2)1, 2,Á ).
j j j(cid:3)1

which is exact to 6D, the exact 7D-value being 0.3864185.
(b) Backward.For (18) we use jshown in the second column, and in each column the last number. Since
r(cid:2)(1.72(cid:4)2.00) 0.1(cid:2)(cid:4)2.8,we thus get from (18)

Those undesirable oscillations are avoided by the method of splines initiated by I. J.
Schoenberg in 1946 (Quarterly of Applied Mathematics 4, pp. 45–99, 112–141). This
method is widely used in practice. It also laid the foundation for much of modern CAD
(computer-aided design). Its name is borrowed from a draftman’s spline, which is an
elastic rod bent to pass through given points and held in place by weights. The mathematical
idea of the method is as follows:

by fitting these polynomials together into a single continuous curve passing through the
data points, that is,

Thus spline interpolation is piecewise polynomial interpolation.
The simplest q’s would be linear polynomials. However, the curve of a piecewise linear

continuous function has corners and would be of little interest in general—think of
designing the body of a car or a ship.
We shall consider cubic splines because these are the most important ones in applications.

g(x)is given by a polynomial q (x)of degree 3 or less.

(given tangent directions of g(x)at the two endpoints of the interval a(cid:4)x(cid:4)b),then we
have a uniquely determined cubic spline. This is the content of the following existence
and uniqueness theorem, whose proof will also suggest the actual determination of splines.
(Condition (3) will be discussed after the proof.)
THEOREM 1 Existence and Uniqueness of Cubic Splines
Á
Let (x , f ), (x , f ), , (x , f ) with given (arbitrarily spaced) x [see (1)] and
0 0 1 1 n n j
given f (cid:2)f(x ), j (cid:2)0, 1,Á , n.Let k and k be any given numbers. Then there
j j 0 n
is one and only one cubic spline g(x) corresponding to (1) and satisfying (2)
and (3).
PROOF By definition, on every subinterval I jgiven by x j(cid:4)x(cid:4)x j(cid:5)1, the spline g(x)must agree
with a polynomial q(x) of degree not exceeding 3 such that
j

j j j j j(cid:5)1 j(cid:5)1
For the derivatives we write
(5) qr (x )(cid:2)k , qr (x )(cid:2)k (j(cid:2)0, 1,Á , n(cid:6)1)
j j j j j(cid:5)1 j(cid:5)1
Á
with k and k given and k , , k to be determined later. Equations (4) and (5) are
0 n 1 n(cid:2)1
four conditions for each q(x). By direct calculation, using the notation
j
(6*) c j(cid:2) h1 (cid:2) x 1 (cid:6)x ( j(cid:2)0, 1,Á , n(cid:6)1)
j j(cid:5)1 j
we can verify that the unique cubic polynomial q(x) (j(cid:2)0, 1,Á , n(cid:6)1) satisfying (4)
j
and (5) is
q(x)(cid:2)f(x )c2(x(cid:6)x )2[1 (cid:5)2c(x(cid:6)x )]

j j j j(cid:5)1
(cid:5)k c2(x(cid:6)x )2(x(cid:6)x ).
j(cid:5)1 j j j(cid:5)1
Differentiating twice, we obtain
(7) qs (x )(cid:2)(cid:6)6c2f(x )(cid:5)6c2f(x )(cid:6)4ck (cid:6)2ck
j j j j j j(cid:5)1 j j j j(cid:5)1

j j(cid:5)1 j j j j(cid:5)1 j j j j(cid:5)1
By definition, g(x) has continuous second derivatives. This gives the conditions
qs (x )(cid:2)qs (x ) (j(cid:2)1,Á , n(cid:6)1).

If we use (8) with j replaced by j(cid:6)1, and (7), these n(cid:6)1 equations become

j j j(cid:2)1 j(cid:5)1 j(cid:5)1 j
This linear system of n(cid:6)1equations has a unique solution k ,Á , k since the coefficient
1 n(cid:2)1
matrix is strictly diagonally dominant (that is, in each row the (positive) diagonal entry is
greater than the sum of the other (positive) entries). Hence the determinant of the matrix
cannot be zero (as follows from Theorem 3 in Sec. 20.7), so that we may determine unique
values k ,Á , k of the first derivative of g(x)at the nodes. This proves the theorem. (cid:2)
1 n(cid:2)1
Storage and Time Demandsin solving (9) are modest, since the matrix of (9) is sparse
(has few nonzero entries) and tridiagonal(may have nonzero entries only on the diagonal
and on the two adjacent “parallels” above and below it). Pivoting (Sec. 7.3) is not necessary
because of that dominance. This makes splines efficient in solving large problems with
thousands of nodes or more. For some literature and some critical comments, see American
Mathematical Monthly 105 (1998), 929–941.

Numeric Integration and Differentiation
In applications, the engineer often encounters integrals that are very difficult or even
impossible to solve analytically. For example, the error function, the Fresnel integrals
(see Probs. 16–25 on nonelementary integrals in this section), and others cannot
be evaluated by the usual methods of calculus (see App. 3, (24)–(44) for such
“difficult” integrals). We then need methods from numerical analysis to evaluate such
integrals. We also need numerics when the integrand of the integral to be evaluated
consists of an empirical function, where we are given some recorded values of that
function. Methods that address these kinds of problems are called methods of numeric
integration.
Numeric integration means the numeric evaluation of integrals

where aand bare given and fis a function given analytically by a formula or empirically
by a table of values. Geometrically, J is the area under the curve of f between a and b

We know that if fis such that we can find a differentiable function Fwhose derivative
is f, then we can evaluate J directly, i.e., without resorting to numeric integration, by
applying the familiar formula

J(cid:2) f(x) dx(cid:2)F(b) (cid:6)F(a) [Fr (x)(cid:2)f(x)].

Your CAS (Mathematica, Maple, etc.) or tables of integrals may be helpful for this purpose.
Rectangular Rule. Trapezoidal Rule
Numeric integration methods are obtained by approximating the integrand fby functions
that can easily be integrated.
The simplest formula, the rectangular rule, is obtained if we subdivide the interval of
integration a(cid:4)x(cid:4)b into n subintervals of equal length h(cid:2)(b(cid:6)a) n and in each
>
subinterval approximate fby the constant f(x*), the value of fat the midpoint x* of the jth

subinterval (Fig. 441). Then fis approximated by a step function(piecewise constant function),

The trapezoidal rule is generally more accurate. We obtain it if we take the same
subdivision as before and approximate f by a broken line of segments (chords) with
Á
endpoints [a, f(a)], [x , f(x )], , [b, f(b)] on the curve of f (Fig. 442). Then the area

under the curve of f between a and b is approximated by n trapezoids of areas

Error Estimation by Halving h is advisable if f is very complicated or unknown, for

Simpson’s Rule of Integration
Piecewise constant approximation of f led to the rectangular rule (1), piecewise linear
approximation to the trapezoidal rule (2), and piecewise quadratic approximation will lead
to Simpson’s rule, which is of great practical importance because it is sufficiently accurate
for most problems, but still sufficiently simple.
To derive Simpson’s rule, we divide the interval of integration a(cid:4)x(cid:4)binto an even
numberof equal subintervals, say, into n(cid:2)2msubintervals of length h(cid:2)(b(cid:6)a) (2m),
with endpoints x ((cid:2) a), x ,Á , x , x ((cid:2) b); see Fig. 443. We now take th> e first

Lagrange polynomial p (x) through (x , f ), (x , f ), (x , f ), where f (cid:2)f(x ). From (3)

Degree of Precision (DP) of an integration formula. This is the maximum degree of
arbitrary polynomials for which the formula gives exact values of integrals over any
intervals.
Hence for the trapezoidal rule,
DP (cid:2)1
because we approximate the curve of f by portions of straight lines (linear polynomials).
For Simpson’s rule we might expect DP (cid:2)2 (why?). Actually,
DP (cid:2)3
by (9) because f(4)is identically zero for a cubic polynomial. This makes Simpson’s rule
sufficiently accurate for most practical problems and accounts for its popularity.
Numeric Stability with respect to rounding is another important property of Simpson’s
rule. Indeed, for the sum of the roundoff errors P of the 2m(cid:5)1values f in (7) we obtain,

2
6(cid:2)1(cid:5)4(cid:5)1is the sum of the coefficients for a pair of intervals in (7); take m(cid:2)1in
(7) to see this. The bound (b(cid:6)a)u is independent of m, so that it cannot increase with
increasing m, that is, with decreasing h. This proves stability. (cid:2)
Newton–Cotes Formulas.We mention that the trapezoidal and Simpson rules are special
closed Newton–Cotes formulas, that is, integration formulas in which f(x) is interpolated
at equally spaced nodes by a polynomial of degree n(n(cid:2)1 for trapezoidal, n(cid:2)2 for
Simpson), and closed means that a and b are nodes (a(cid:2)x , b(cid:2)x ). n (cid:2)3 and higher
0 n
n are used occasionally. From n(cid:2)8 on, some of the coefficients become negative, so
that a positive f could make a negative contribution to an integral, which is absurd. For

Solution. The exact 5D-value of the integral is J(cid:2)1.25953.Simpson’s rule gives
J (cid:2)1 f(0)(cid:5)4f(1)(cid:5)f(2) (cid:2)1(0(cid:5)4(cid:3)0.555360(cid:5)0)(cid:2)0.740480,

Hence (10) gives P (cid:2) 1(1.22974(cid:6)0.74048)(cid:2)0.032617 and thus J(cid:3)J (cid:5)P (cid:2)1.26236, with an

well worthwhile.
Adaptive Integration
The idea is to adapt step hto the variability of f(x).That is, where fvaries but little, we can
proceed in large steps without causing a substantial error in the integral, but where fvaries
rapidly, we have to take small steps in order to stay everywhere close enough to the curve
of f.
Changing his done systematically, usually by halving h, and automatically (not “by hand”)
depending on the size of the (estimated) error over a subinterval. The subinterval is halved
if the corresponding error is still too large, that is, larger than a given tolerance TOL
(maximum admissible absolute error), or is not halved if the error is less than or equal to
TOL (or doubled if the error is very small).
Adapting is one of the techniques typical of modern software. In connection with
integration it can be applied to various methods. We explain it here for Simpson’s rule. In
Table 19.6 an asterisk means that for that subinterval, TOL has been reached.
EXAMPLE 6 Adaptive Integration with Simpson’s Rule
Integrate f(x)(cid:2)1px4 cos 1px from x(cid:2)0 to 2 by adaptive integration and with Simpson’s rule and
4 4
TOL[0, 2](cid:2)0.0002.
Solution. Table 19.6 shows the calculations. Figure 444 shows the integrand f(x)and the adapted intervals
used. The first two intervals ([0, 0.5], [0.5, 1.0]) have length 0.5, hence h(cid:2)0.25[because we use 2m(cid:2)2
subintervals in Simpson’s rule (7**)]. The next two intervals ([1.00, 1.25], [1.25, 1.50]) have length 0.25
(hence h(cid:2)0.125) and the last four intervals have length 0.125. Sample computations. For 0.740480 see
Example 5. Formula (10) gives (0.123716(cid:6)0.122794) 15(cid:2)0.000061.Note that 0.123716 refers to [0, 0.5]
>
and [0.5, 1], so that we must subtract the value corresponding to [0, 1] in the line before. Etc.
TOL[0, 2](cid:2)0.0002gives 0.0001 for subintervals of length 1, 0.00005 for length 0.5, etc. The value of the
integral obtained is the sum of the values marked by an asterisk (for which the error estimate has become
less than TOL). This gives
J(cid:3)0.123716(cid:5)0.528895(cid:5)0.388263(cid:5)0.218483(cid:2)1.25936.
The exact 5D-value is J(cid:2)1.25953. Hence the error is 0.00017. This is about 1 200of the absolute value of
> (cid:2)
that in Example 5. Our more extensive computation has produced a much better result.

Gauss Integration Formulas
Maximum Degree of Precision
Our integration formulas discussed so far use function values at predetermined
(equidistant) x-values (nodes) and give exact results for polynomials not exceeding a
c19-b.qxd 11/2/10 8:33 PM Page 837
SEC. 19.5 Numeric Integration and Differentiation 837
certain degree [called the degree of precision; see after (9)]. But we can get much more
accurate integration formulas as follows. We set
(cid:2)1 n
(11) f (t) dt (cid:3) a A j f j [ f j(cid:2)f (t j)]
(cid:2)1 j(cid:2)1
with fixed n, and t(cid:2)(cid:9)1obtained from x(cid:2)a, bby setting x(cid:2)1[a(t(cid:6)1)(cid:5)b(t(cid:5)1)].
Á Á2
Then we determine the ncoefficients A , , A and nnodes t , , t so that (11) gives
1 n 1 n
exact results for polynomials of degree k as high as possible. Since n(cid:5)n(cid:2)2n is the
number of coefficients of a polynomial of degree 2n(cid:6)1, it follows that k(cid:4)2n(cid:6)1.
Gauss has shown that exactness for polynomials of degree not exceeding 2n(cid:6)1(instead
of n(cid:6)1 for predetermined nodes) can be attained, and he has given the location of the
t ((cid:2)the jth zero of the Legendre polynomial P in Sec. 5.3) and the coefficients A which
j n j
depend on nbut not on f(t),and are obtained by using Lagrange’s interpolation polynomial,
as shown in Ref. [E5] listed in App. 1. With these t and A,formula (11) is called a Gauss

integration formula or Gauss quadrature formula. Its degree of precision is 2n(cid:6)1, as
just explained. Table 19.7 gives the values needed for
n(cid:2)2,Á

Solution. x(cid:2)t(cid:5)1gives f(t)(cid:2)1p(t(cid:5)1)4 cos (1p(t(cid:5)1)),as needed in (11). For n(cid:2)4we calculate (6S)

The error is 0.00003 because J(cid:2)1.25953(6S). Calculating with 10S and n(cid:2)4gives the same result; so the
error is due to the formula, not rounding. For n(cid:2)5and 10S we get J(cid:3)1.259526185,too large by the amount
0.000000250 because J(cid:2)1.259525935 (10S).The accuracy is impressive, particularly if we compare the amount
(cid:2)
of work with that in Example 6.
Gauss integration is of considerable practical importance. Whenever the integrand f is
given by a formula (not just by a table of numbers) or when experimental measurements
can be set at times t (or whatever trepresents) shown in Table 19.7 or in Ref. [GenRef1],
j
then the great accuracy of Gauss integration outweighs the disadvantage of the complicated
t and A (which may have to be stored). Also, Gauss coefficients A are positive for all
j j j
n, in contrast with some of the Newton–Cotes coefficients for larger n.
Of course, there are frequent applications with equally spaced nodes, so that Gauss
integration does not apply (or has no great advantage if one first has to get the t in (11)
j
by interpolation).
Since the endpoints (cid:6)1and 1 of the interval of integration in (11) are not zeros of P ,
n
Á
they do not occur among t , , t , and the Gauss formula (11) is called, therefore, an
0 n
open formula, in contrast with a closed formula, in which the endpoints of the interval
of integration are t and t . [For example, (2) and (7) are closed formulas.]

Numeric Differentiation
Numeric differentiationis the computation of values of the derivative of a function ffrom
given values of f. Numeric differentiation should be avoided whenever possible. Whereas
integrationis a smoothing process and is not very sensitive to small inaccuracies in function
r
values, differentiationtends to make matters rough and generally gives values of f that are
much less accurate than those of f. The difficulty with differentiation is tied in with the
definition of the derivative, which is the limit of the difference quotient, and, in that quotient,
you usually have the difference of a large quantity divided by a small quantity. This can
cause numerical instability. While being aware of this caveat, we must still develop basic
differentiation formulas for use in numeric solutions of differential equations.
We use the notations
fr(cid:2)fr
(x),
fs(cid:2)fs
(x),etc., and may obtain rough approximation

More accurate approximations are obtained by differentiating suitable Lagrange

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Numerics in General
In this chapter we discussed concepts that are relevant throughout numeric work as
a whole and methods of a general nature, as opposed to methods for linear algebra
(Chap. 20) or differential equations (Chap. 21).
In scientific computations we use the floating-point representation of numbers
(Sec. 19.1); fixed-point representation is less suitable in most cases.

inaccuracy of measured values, truncation (that is, replacement of integrals by sums,
series by partial sums), and so on.
An algorithm is called numerically stableif small changes in the initial data give
only correspondingly small changes in the final results. Unstable algorithms are
generally useless because errors may become so large that results will be very
inaccurate. The numeric instability of algorithms must not be confused with the
mathematical instability of problems (“ill-conditioned problems,” Sec. 19.2).
Fixed-point iteration is a method for solving equations f(x) (cid:2)0 in which the
equation is first transformed algebraically to x(cid:2)g(x), an initial guess x for the
0
Á
solution is made, and then approximations x , x , , are successively computed

by iteration from (see Sec. 19.2)

This method is of second order (Theorem 2, Sec. 19.2). If we replace f in (3) by
a difference quotient (geometrically: we replace the tangent by a secant), we obtain
the secant method;see (10) in Sec. 19.2. For the bisection method(which converges
slowly) and the method of false position, see Problem Set 19.2.
Polynomial interpolation means the determination of a polynomial p (x) such

For given data, p (x) of degree n (or less) is unique. However, it can be written in

different forms, notably in Lagrange’s form(4), Sec. 19.3, or in Newton’s divided

A similar formula is Newton’s backward difference interpolation formula(formula

Interpolation polynomials may become numerically unstable as n increases, and
instead of interpolating and approximating by a single high-degree polynomial it is
preferable to use a cubic spline g(x), that is, a twice continuously differentiable
interpolation function [thus, g(x )(cid:2)f], which in each subinterval x (cid:4)x(cid:4)x

Simpson’s rule is the most important of the Newton–Cotes formulas, which are
obtained by integrating Lagrange interpolation polynomials, linear ones for the
trapezoidal rule (2), Sec. 19.5, quadratic for Simpson’s rule, cubic for the three-
eights rule (see the Chap. 19 Review Problems), etc.
Adaptive integration (Sec. 19.5, Example 6) is integration that adjusts
(“adapts”) the step (automatically) to the variability of f(x).
Romberg integration (Team Project 26, Problem Set 19.5) starts from the
trapezoidal rule (2), Sec. 19.5, with h, h 2, h 4, etc. and improves results by

systematically adding error estimates.
Gauss integration (11), Sec. 19.5, is important because of its great accuracy
(DP (cid:2)2n(cid:6)1, compared to Newton–Cotes’s DP (cid:2)n(cid:6)1 or n). This is achieved
by an optimal choice of the nodes, which are not equally spaced; see Table 19.7,
Sec. 19.5.
Numeric differentiationis discussed at the end of Sec. 19.5. (Its main application
(to differential equations) follows in Chap. 21.)

C H A P T E R
Numeric Linear Algebra
This chapter deals with two main topics. The first topic is how to solve linear systems of
equations numerically. We start with Gauss elimination, which may be familiar to some
readers, but this time in an algorithmic setting with partial pivoting. Variants of this method
(Doolittle, Crout, Cholesky, Gauss–Jordan) are discussed in Sec. 20.2. All these methods
are direct methods, that is, methods of numerics where we know in advance how many
steps they will take until they arrive at a solution. However, small pivots and roundoff
error magnification may produce nonsensical results, such as in the Gauss method. A shift
occurs in Sec. 20.3, where we discuss numeric iteration methods or indirect methods to
address our first topic. Here we cannot be totally sure how many steps will be needed to
arrive at a good answer. Several factors—such as how far is the starting value from our
initial solution, how is the problem structure influencing speed of convergence, how
accurate would we like our result to be—determine the outcome of these methods.
Moreover, our computation cycle may not converge. Gauss–Seidel iteration and Jacobi
iteration are discussed in Sec. 20.3. Section 20.4 is at the heart of addressing the pitfalls
of numeric linear algebra. It is concerned with problems that are ill-conditioned. We learn
to estimate how “bad” such a problem is by calculating the condition number of its matrix.
The second topic (Secs. 20.6–20.9) is how to solve eigenvalue problems numerically.
Eigenvalue problems appear throughout engineering, physics, mathematics, economics,
and many areas. For large or very large matrices, determining the eigenvalues is difficult
as it involves finding the roots of the characteristic equations, which are high-degree
polynomials. As such, there are different approaches to tackling this problem. Some
methods, such as Gerschgorin’s method and Collatz’s method only provide a range in
which eigenvalues lie and thus are known as inclusion methods. Others such as
tridiagonalization and QR-factorization actually find all the eigenvalues. The area is quite
ingeneous and should be fascinating to the reader.
COMMENT. This chapter is independent of Chap. 19and can be studied immediately
after Chap. 7 or 8.

Linear Systems: Gauss Elimination
The basic method for solving systems of linear equations by Gauss elimination and back
substitution was explained in Sec. 7.3. If you covered Sec. 7.3, you may wonder why we
cover Gauss elimination again. The reason is that here we cover Gauss elimination in the

setting of numericsand introduce new material such as pivoting, row scaling, and operation
count. Furthermore, we give an algorithmic representation of Gauss elimination in Table 20.1
that can be readily converted into software. We also show when Gauss elimination runs
into difficulties with small pivots and what to do about it. The reader should pay close
attention to the material as variants of Gauss elimination are covered in Sec. 20.2 and,
furthermore, the general problem of solving linear systems is the focus of the first half of
this chapter.

A solution of (1) is a set of numbers x , , x that satisfy all the n equations, and a
1 n
solution vector of (1) is a vector x whose components constitute a solution of (1).
The method of solving such a system by determinants (Cramer’s rule in Sec. 7.7) is
not practical, even with efficient methods for evaluating the determinants.
A practical method for the solution of a linear system is the so-called Gauss elimination,
which we shall now discuss (proceeding independently of Sec. 7.3).

846 CHAP. 20 Numeric Linear Algebra
Gauss Elimination
This standard method for solving linear systems (1) is a systematic process of elimination
that reduces (1) to triangular formbecause the system can then be easily solved by back
substitution. For instance, a triangular system is
3x (cid:4)5x (cid:4)2x (cid:2) 8
1 2 3
8x (cid:4)2x (cid:2)(cid:5)7
2 3
6x (cid:2) 3
3
and back substitution gives x (cid:2)3 (cid:2)1 from the third equation, then
3 6 2
x (cid:2)1((cid:5)7(cid:5)2x )(cid:2)(cid:5)1
2 8 3
from the second equation, and finally from the first equation
x (cid:2)1(8 (cid:5)5x (cid:5)2x )(cid:2)4.
1 3 2 3
How do we reduce a given system (1) to triangular form? In the first step we eliminate
x from equations E to E in (1). We do this by adding (or subtracting) suitable multi-
1 2 n
Á
ples of E to (from) equations E , , E and taking the resulting equations, call them
1 2 n
Á
E*, , E* as the new equations. The first equation, E , is called the pivot equation in
2 n 1
this step, and a is called the pivot. This equation is left unaltered. In the second step
11
we take the new second equation E* (which no longer contains x ) as the pivot equation
2 1
and use it to eliminate x from E* to E*. And so on. After n(cid:5)1 steps this gives a
2 3 n
triangular system that can be solved by back substitution as just shown. In this way we
obtain precisely all solutions of the given system (as proved in Sec. 7.3).
The pivot a (in step k) must be different from zero and should be large in absolute
kk
value to avoid roundoff magnification by the multiplication in the elimination. For this
we choose as our pivot equation one that has the absolutely largest a in column kon or
jk
below the main diagonal (actually, the uppermost if there are several such equations). This
popular method is called partial pivoting. It is used in CASs (e.g., in Maple).
Partial pivoting distinguishes it from total pivoting, which involves both row and
column interchanges but is hardly used in practice.
Let us illustrate this method with a simple example.

Subtract 3 (cid:2)1 times the pivot equation from the second equation.

This agrees with the values given above, before the beginning of the example.
The general algorithm for the Gauss elimination is shown in Table 20.1. To help explain
the algorithm, we have numbered some of its lines. b is denoted by a ,for uniformity.
j j,n(cid:4)1
In lines 1 and 2 we look for a possible pivot. [For k(cid:2)1we can always find one; otherwise
x would not occur in (1).] In line 2 we do pivoting if necessary, picking an a of greatest

in line 5. Accordingly, a etc. in all lines refer to the most recent equations, and j(cid:7)k

In line 3, if the last equation in the triangular system is 0(cid:2)b* (cid:6)0, we have no

we had 8 as the greatest coefficient in Column 2, hence j (cid:2)3.We interchanged equations 2 and 3, computed

Error estimates for the Gauss elimination are discussed in Ref. [E5] listed in App. 1.
Row scaling means the multiplication of each Row j by a suitable scaling factor s. It is
j
done in connection with partial pivoting to get more accurate solutions. Despite much
research (see Refs. [E9], [E24] in App. 1) and the proposition of several principles, scaling
is still not well understood. As a possibility, one can scale for pivot choice only (not in
the calculation, to avoid additional roundoff) and take as first pivot the entry a for which

the further steps of the Gauss elimination.
For instance, for the system

we might pick 4 as pivot, but dividing the first equation by 104 gives the system in
Example 3, for which the second equation is a better pivot equation.
Operation Count
Quite generally, important factors in judging the quality of a numeric method are
Amount of storage
Amount of time ((cid:3)number of operations)
Effect of roundoff error
For the Gauss elimination, the operation count for a full matrix (a matrix with relatively
many nonzero entries) is as follows. In Step k we eliminate x from n(cid:5)k equations.
k
This needs n(cid:5)k divisions in computing the m (line 3) and (n(cid:5)k)(n(cid:5)k(cid:4)1)

multiplications and as many subtractions (both in line 4). Since we do n(cid:5)1 steps, k
goes from 1 to n(cid:5)1 and thus the total number of operations in this forward
elimination is
n(cid:4)1 n(cid:4)1
f (n)(cid:2) a (n(cid:5)k)(cid:4)2a (n(cid:5)k)(n(cid:5)k(cid:4)1) (write n(cid:5)k(cid:2)s)

where 2n3 3 is obtained by dropping lower powers of n. We see that f(n) grows about

proportional to n3. We say that f(n) is of order n3 and write
f(n) (cid:2)O(n3)
where O suggests order. The general definition of O is as follows. We write
f(n) (cid:2)O(h(n))
if the quotients ƒf(n) h(n)ƒ and ƒh(n) f(n)ƒ remain bounded (do not trail off to infinity)

SEC. 20.1 Linear Systems: Gauss Elimination 851
In the back substitution of x we make n(cid:5)imultiplications and as many subtractions,

as well as 1 division. Hence the number of operations in the back substitution is

We see that it grows more slowly than the number of operations in the forward elimination
of the Gauss algorithm, so that it is negligible for large systems because it is smaller by
a factor n, approximately. For instance, if an operation takes

elimination, which require fewer arithmetic operations. They are named after Doolittle,
Crout, and Cholesky and use the idea of the LU-factorization of A, which we explain
first.
An LU-factorization of a given square matrix A is of the form
(2) A(cid:2)LU
where L is lower triangular and U is upper triangular. For example,
2 3 1 0 2 3
A(cid:2) (cid:2)LU(cid:2) .

It can be proved that for any nonsingular matrix (see Sec. 7.8) the rows can be reordered
so that the resulting matrix A has an LU-factorization (2) in which L turns out to be the
Á
matrix of the multipliers m of the Gauss elimination, with main diagonal 1, , 1, and
jk
U is the matrix of the triangular system at the end of the Gauss elimination. (See Ref.
[E5], pp. 155–156, listed in App. 1.)
The crucial ideanow is that Land Uin (2) can be computed directly, without solving
simultaneous equations (thus, without using the Gauss elimination). As a count shows,
this needs about n3 3 operations, about half as many as the Gauss elimination, which
>
needs about 2n3 3(see Sec. 20.1). And once we have (2), we can use it for solving Ax (cid:2)b

in two steps, involving only about n2 operations, simply by noting that Ax (cid:2)LUx (cid:2)b
may be written
(3) (a) Ly(cid:2)b where (b) Ux(cid:2)y
and solving first (3a) for y and then (3b) for x. Here we can require that L have main
Á
diagonal 1, , 1 as stated before; then this is called Doolittle’s method.1 Both systems
(3a) and (3b) are triangular, so we can solve them as in the back substitution for the Gauss
elimination.
A similar method, Crout’s method,2is obtained from (2) if U(instead of L) is required
Á
to have main diagonal 1, , 1. In either case the factorization (2) is unique.

and collaborator of ERWIN KREYSZIG, see [E20]—taught Cholesky’s method in his analysis course at King’s

The Cholesky LLT-factorization is numerically stable (as defined in Sec. 19.1).

That is, l2 is bounded by an entry of A, which means stability against rounding. (cid:2)

Gauss–Jordan Elimination. Matrix Inversion
Another variant of the Gauss elimination is the Gauss–Jordan elimination, introduced
by W. Jordan in 1920, in which back substitution is avoided by additional computations
that reduce the matrix to diagonal form, instead of the triangular form in the Gauss
elimination. But this reduction from the Gauss triangular to the diagonal form requires
more operations than back substitution does, so that the method is disadvantageous for
solving systems Ax (cid:2)b. But it may be used for matrix inversion, where the situation is
as follows.

However, it is preferable to produce

way as the Gauss–Jordan algorithm, reducing Ato I. A typical illustrative example of this
method is given in Sec. 7.8.

Linear Systems: Solution by Iteration
The Gauss elimination and its variants in the last two sections belong to the direct methods
for solving linear systems of equations; these are methods that give solutions after an
amount of computation that can be specified in advance. In contrast, in an indirect or
iterative method we start from an approximation to the true solution and, if successful,
obtain better and better approximations from a computational cycle repeated as often as
may be necessary for achieving a required accuracy, so that the amount of arithmetic
depends upon the accuracy required and varies from case to case.
We apply iterative methods if the convergence is rapid (if matrices have large main
diagonal entries, as we shall see), so that we save operations compared to a direct method.
We also use iterative methods if a large system is sparse, that is, has very many zero
coefficients, so that one would waste space in storing zeros, for instance, 9995 zeros per
equation in a potential problem of 104 equations in 104 unknowns with typically only 5
nonzero terms per equation (more on this in Sec. 21.4).
Gauss–Seidel Iteration Method4
This is an iterative method of great practical importance, which we can simply explain in
terms of an example.

(Equations of this form arise in the numeric solution of PDEs and in spline interpolation.) We write the system

These equations are now used for iteration; that is, we start from a (possibly poor) approximation to the solution,
say x(0)(cid:2)100, x(0)(cid:2)100, x(0)(cid:2)100, x(0)(cid:2)100,and compute from (2) a perhaps better approximation

x(1)= 0.25x(1)+0.25x(1) + 25.00 = 68.75
4 2 3
Use “new” values
These equations (3) are obtained from (2) by substituting on the right the most recentapproximation for each
unknown. In fact, corresponding values replace previous ones as soon as they have been computed, so that in
the second and third equations we use x(1)(not x(0)),and in the last equation of (3) we use x(1)and x(1)(not
1 1 2 3
x(0)and x(0)).Using the same principle, we obtain in the next step

rearrange the equations so that no diagonal coefficient is zero; then we may divide each

Convergence and Matrix Norms
An iteration method for solving Ax(cid:2)b is said to converge for an initial x(0) if the
corresponding iterative sequence x(0), x(1), x(2), Á converges to a solution of the given
system. Convergence depends on the relation between x(m)and x(m(cid:4)1). To get this relation
for the Gauss–Seidel method, we use (6). We first have
(I (cid:4)L) x(m(cid:4)1)(cid:2)b(cid:5)Ux(m)
and by multiplying by (I
(cid:4)L)(cid:4)1
from the left,
(7) x(m(cid:4)1)(cid:2)Cx(m)(cid:4)(I (cid:4)L)(cid:4)1 b where C(cid:2)(cid:5)(I (cid:4)L)(cid:4)1 U.
The Gauss–Seidel iteration converges for every x(0) if and only if all the eigenvalues
(Sec. 8.1) of the “iteration matrix” C(cid:2)[c ] have absolute value less than 1. (Proof in
jk
Ref. [E5], p. 191, listed in App. 1.)
CAUTION!If you want to get C, first divide the rows of Aby a to have main diagonal
jj
1,Á , 1.If the spectral radiusof C((cid:2)maximum of those absolute values) is small, then
the convergence is rapid.
Sufficient Convergence Condition. A sufficient condition for convergence is
(8) (cid:5)C(cid:5)(cid:8)1.
Here (cid:5)C(cid:5) is some matrix norm, such as
n n
(9) (cid:5)C (cid:5)(cid:2) Ba a c jk2 (Frobenius norm)
j(cid:2)1k(cid:2)1
or the greatest of the sums of the ƒc ƒ in a column of C

These are the most frequently used matrix norms in numerics.
In most cases the choice of one of these norms is a matter of computational convenience.
However, the following example shows that sometimes one of these norms is preferable
to the others.

and conclude from (8) that this Gauss–Seidel iteration converges. It is interesting that the other two norms would
permit no conclusion, as you should verify. Of course, this points to the fact that (8) is sufficient for convergence
(cid:2)
rather than necessary.
Residual. Given a system Ax (cid:2)b, the residual r of x with respect to this system is
defined by
(12) r(cid:2)b(cid:5)Ax.
Clearly, r(cid:2)0if and only if xis a solution. Hence r(cid:6)0for an approximate solution. In
the Gauss–Seidel iteration, at each stage we modify or relax a component of an
approximate solution in order to reduce a component of rto zero. Hence the Gauss–Seidel
iteration belongs to a class of methods often called relaxation methods. More about the
residual follows in the next section.
Jacobi Iteration
The Gauss–Seidel iteration is a method of successive corrections because for each
component we successively replace an approximation of a component by a corresponding
new approximation as soon as the latter has been computed. An iteration method is called
a method of simultaneous correctionsif no component of an approximation x(m)is used
until allthe components of x(m)have been computed. A method of this type is the Jacobi
iteration, which is similar to the Gauss–Seidel iteration but involves notusing improved
values until a step has been completed and then replacing x(m)by x(m(cid:4)1)at once, directly
before the beginning of the next step. Hence if we write Ax (cid:2)b(witha (cid:2)1as before!)

in the form x(cid:2)b(cid:4)(I (cid:5)A)x, the Jacobi iteration in matrix notation is

This method converges for every choice of x(0)if and only if the spectral radius of I(cid:5)A

all n equations can be solved simultaneously at each iteration step.

Linear Systems: Ill-Conditioning, Norms
One does not need much experience to observe that some systems Ax (cid:2)b are good,
giving accurate solutions even under roundoff or coefficient inaccuracies, whereas others
are bad, so that these inaccuracies affect the solution strongly. We want to see what is
going on and whether or not we can “trust” a linear system. Let us first formulate the two
relevant concepts (ill- and well-conditioned) for general numeric work and then turn to
linear systems and matrices.
A computational problem is called ill-conditioned(or ill-posed) if “small” changes in
the data (the input) cause “large” changes in the solution (the output). On the other hand,
a problem is called well-conditioned(or well-posed) if “small” changes in the data cause
only “small” changes in the solution.
These concepts are qualitative. We would certainly regard a magnification of inaccuracies
by a factor 100 as “large,” but could debate where to draw the line between “large” and
“small,” depending on the kind of problem and on our viewpoint. Double precision may
sometimes help, but if data are measured inaccurately, one should attempt changing the
mathematical setting of the problem to a well-conditioned one.
Let us now turn to linear systems. Figure 445 explains that ill-conditioning occurs if
and only if the two equations give two nearly parallel lines, so that their intersection point
(the solution of the system) moves substantially if we raise or lower a line just a little.
For larger systems the situation is similar in principle, although geometry no longer helps.
We shall see that we may regard ill-conditioning as an approach to singularity of the
matrix.

EXAMPLE 1 An Ill-Conditioned System
You may verify that the system
0.9999x(cid:5)1.0001y(cid:2)1
x(cid:5) y(cid:2)1
has the solution x(cid:2)0.5, y(cid:2)(cid:5)0.5,whereas the system
0.9999x(cid:5)1.0001y(cid:2)1
x(cid:5) y(cid:2)1(cid:4)P
has the solution x(cid:2)0.5(cid:4)5000.5P, y(cid:2)(cid:5)0.5(cid:4)4999.5P.This shows that the system is ill-conditioned because
a change on the right of magnitude Pproduces a change in the solution of magnitude 5000P,approximately.
(cid:2)
We see that the lines given by the equations have nearly the same slope.
Well-conditioning can be asserted if the main diagonal entries of A have large absolute
values compared to those of the other entries. Similarly if
A(cid:4)1
and A have maximum
entries of about the same absolute value.
Ill-conditioningis indicated if
A(cid:4)1has
entries of large absolute value compared to those
of the solution (about 5000 in Example 1) and if poor approximate solutions may still
produce small residuals.
(cid:2)

Now b(cid:2)Ax, so that
(cid:2)
(2) r(cid:2)A(x(cid:5)Ax).
(cid:2)
Hence r is small if x has high accuracy, but the converse may be false:

c2.0001d c1.0000 1.0001d c0.0001d c2.0001d c2.0001d c 0.0000d
From this, a naive person might draw the false conclusion that the approximation should be accurate to 3 or 4
decimals.
Our result is probably unexpected, but we shall see that it has to do with the fact that the system is
(cid:2)
ill-conditioned.
Our goal is to show that ill-conditioning of a linear system and of its coefficient matrix A
can be measured by a number, the condition number (cid:2)(A).Other measures for ill-conditioning
c20-a.qxd 11/2/10 8:57 PM Page 866
866 CHAP. 20 Numeric Linear Algebra
have also been proposed, but (cid:2)(A)is probably the most widely used one. (cid:2)(A)is defined in
terms of norm, a concept of great general interest throughout numerics (and in modern
mathematics in general!). We shall reach our goal in three steps, discussing
1. Vector norms
2. Matrix norms
3. Condition number (cid:2) of a square matrix
Vector Norms
A vector normfor column vectors x(cid:2)[x ]with ncomponents (nfixed) is a generalized
j
length or distance. It is denoted by (cid:5)x(cid:5) and is defined by four properties of the usual
length of vectors in three-dimensional space, namely,
(a) (cid:5)x(cid:5) is a nonnegative real number.
(b) (cid:5)x(cid:5)(cid:2)0 if and only if x(cid:2)0.
(3)
(c) (cid:5)kx(cid:5)(cid:2) ƒkƒ (cid:5)x(cid:5) for all k.
(d) (cid:5)x(cid:4)y(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:5)x(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:5)y(cid:5) (Triangle inequality).
If we use several norms, we label them by a subscript. Most important in connection with
computations is the p-norm defined by
(4) (cid:5) x (cid:5) p(cid:2)(ƒx 1ƒp(cid:4) ƒx 2ƒp(cid:4) Á (cid:4) ƒx nƒp)1 >p
where p is a fixed number and p(cid:7)1. In practice, one usually takes p(cid:2)1 or 2 and, as a
third norm, (cid:5)x(cid:5) (the latter as defined below), that is,
(cid:6)
(5) (cid:5)x(cid:5) (cid:2) ƒx ƒ (cid:4) Á (cid:4) ƒx ƒ (“l -norm”)
1 1 n 1
(6) (cid:5)x(cid:5) (cid:2) 2x2(cid:4) Á (cid:4)x2 (“Euclidean” or “l -norm”)
2 1 n 2
(7) (cid:5)x(cid:5) (cid:2)max ƒx ƒ (“l -norm”).
(cid:6) j (cid:6)
j
For n(cid:2)3 the l -norm is the usual length of a vector in three-dimensional space. The
2
l -norm and l -norm are generally more convenient in computation. But all three norms
1 (cid:6)
are in common use.
EXAMPLE 3 Vector Norms
If xT(cid:2)[2 (cid:5)3 0 1(cid:5)4], then (cid:5) x (cid:5) 1(cid:2)10, (cid:5) x (cid:5) 2(cid:2) 130, (cid:5) x (cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:2)4. (cid:2)
(cid:2) (cid:2)
In three-dimensional space, two points with position vectors xand x have distance ƒx(cid:5) xƒ
(cid:2)
from each other. For a linear system Ax(cid:2)b, this suggests that we take (cid:5)x(cid:5) x(cid:5) as a
measure of inaccuracy and call it the distance between an exact and an approximate
(cid:2)
solution, or the error of x.
Matrix Norm
If A is an n(cid:3)n matrix and x any vector with n components, then Ax is a vector with n
components. We now take a vector norm and consider (cid:5)x(cid:5)and (cid:5)Ax(cid:5).One can prove (see
c20-a.qxd 11/2/10 8:57 PM Page 867
SEC. 20.4 Linear Systems: Ill-Conditioning, Norms 867
Ref. [E17]. pp. 77, 92–93, listed in App. 1) that there is a number c (depending on A)
such that
(8) (cid:5)Ax(cid:5)(cid:11)c(cid:5)x(cid:5) for all x.
Let x(cid:6)0.Then (cid:5)x(cid:5)(cid:10)0by (3b) and division gives (cid:5)Ax(cid:5) (cid:5)x(cid:5)(cid:11)c.We obtain the smallest
>
possible c valid for all x ((cid:6) 0) by taking the maximum on the left. This smallest c is
called the matrix norm of Acorresponding to the vector norm we pickedand is denoted
by (cid:5)A(cid:5). Thus
(cid:5)Ax(cid:5)
(9) (cid:5)A(cid:5)(cid:2)max (x(cid:6)0),
(cid:5)x(cid:5)
the maximum being taken over all x(cid:6)0. Alternatively [see (c) in Team Project 24],
(10) (cid:5)A(cid:5)(cid:2) max (cid:5)Ax(cid:5).
(cid:5) x (cid:5)(cid:2)1
The maximum in (10) and thus also in (9) exists. And the name “matrix norm” is
justified because (cid:5)A(cid:5)satisfies (3) with xand yreplaced by Aand B. (Proofs in Ref. [E17]
pp. 77, 92–93.)
Note carefully that (cid:5)A(cid:5)depends on the vector norm that we selected. In particular, one
can show that
for the l -norm (5) one gets the column “sum” norm (10), Sec. 20.3,
1
for the l -norm (7) one gets the row “sum” norm (11), Sec. 20.3.
(cid:9)
By taking our best possible (our smallest) c(cid:2)(cid:5)A(cid:5) we have from (8)
(11) (cid:5)Ax(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:5)A(cid:5) (cid:5)x(cid:5) .
This is the formula we shall need. Formula (9) also implies for two n(cid:3)n matrices (see
Ref. [E17], p. 98)
(12) (cid:5)AB(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:5)A(cid:5) (cid:5)B(cid:5), thus (cid:5)An(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:5)A(cid:5)n .
See Refs. [E9] and [E17] for other useful formulas on norms.
Before we go on, let us do a simple illustrative computation.
EXAMPLE 4 Matrix Norms
Compute the matrix norms of the coefficient matrix Ain Example 1 and of its inverse A(cid:4)1,assuming that we
use (a) the l 1-vector norm, (b) the l(cid:9)`-vector norm.

(b) The l(cid:9)-vector norm gives the row “sum” norm (11), Sec. 20.3; thus (cid:5) A (cid:5)(cid:2)2, (cid:5) A(cid:4)1(cid:5)(cid:2)10000.5from
Row 1. We notice that (cid:5) A(cid:4)1 (cid:5)is surprisingly large, which makes the product (cid:5) A (cid:5) (cid:5) A(cid:4)1(cid:5)large (20,001). We shall
see below that this is typical of an ill-conditioned system.
Condition Number of a Matrix
We are now ready to introduce the key concept in our discussion of ill-conditioning, the
condition number (cid:2)(A) of a (nonsingular) square matrix A, defined by
(13) (cid:2)(A)(cid:2)(cid:5)A(cid:5) (cid:5)A(cid:4)1 (cid:5) .
The role of the condition number is seen from the following theorem.
THEOREM 1 Condition Number
A linear system of equations Ax(cid:2)band its matrix Awhose condition number (13)
is small are well-conditioned. A large condition number indicates ill-conditioning.
PROOF b(cid:2)Ax and (11) give (cid:5)b(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:5)A(cid:5) (cid:5)x(cid:5). Let b(cid:6)0 and x(cid:6)0. Then division by (cid:5)b(cid:5) (cid:5)x(cid:5)
gives
(cid:5)A(cid:5)
1
(14) (cid:11) .
(cid:5)x(cid:5) (cid:5)b(cid:5)
Multiplying (2)
r(cid:2)A(x(cid:5)(cid:2)
x) by
A(cid:4)1
from the left and interchanging sides, we have
x(cid:5)(cid:2)
x
(cid:2)A(cid:4)1r.
Now (11) with
A(cid:4)1
and r instead of A and x yields
(cid:5)x(cid:5)(cid:2) x (cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:5) A(cid:4)1r(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:5)A(cid:4)1 (cid:5) (cid:5) r(cid:5) .
Division by (cid:5)x(cid:5) [note that (cid:5)x(cid:5)(cid:6)0 by (3b)] and use of (14) finally gives
(cid:2)
(cid:5)x(cid:5) x(cid:5) (cid:5)A(cid:5) (cid:5)r(cid:5)
(15) (cid:11)
1
(cid:5)A(cid:4)1 (cid:5) (cid:5) r(cid:5)(cid:11) (cid:5)A(cid:4)1(cid:5) (cid:5) r(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:2)(A) .
(cid:5)x(cid:5) (cid:5)x(cid:5) (cid:5)b(cid:5) (cid:5)b(cid:5)
(cid:2)
Hence if (cid:2)(A) is small, a small (cid:5)r(cid:5) (cid:5)b(cid:5) implies a small relative error (cid:5)x(cid:5) x (cid:5) (cid:5)x(cid:5), so
> >
that the system is well-conditioned. However, this does not hold if (cid:2)(A) is large; then a
(cid:2)
small (cid:5)r(cid:5) (cid:5)b(cid:5) does not necessarily imply a small relative error (cid:5)x(cid:5) x(cid:5) (cid:5)x(cid:5). (cid:2)

For instance, if b(cid:2)[14 0 28]T, the Gauss algorithm gives the solution x(cid:2)[2 (cid:5)5 9]T, (confirm
this). Since the main diagonal entries of Aare relatively large, we can expect reasonably good convergence of
the Gauss–Seidel iteration. Indeed, starting from, say, x (cid:2)[1 1 1]T,we obtain the first 8 steps (3D values)

EXAMPLE 6 Ill-Conditioned Linear System
Example 4 gives by (10) or (11), Sec. 20.3, for the matrix in Example 1 the very large condition number
(cid:2)(A)(cid:2)2.0001(cid:3)10000(cid:2)2(cid:3)10000.5(cid:2)200001.This confirms that the system is very ill-conditioned.
Similarly in Example 2, where by (4*),Sec. 7.8 and 6D-computation,
1 1.0001 (cid:5)1.0000 5000.5 (cid:5)5.000.0

0.0002 c(cid:5)1.0000 1.0001d c(cid:5)5000.0 5000.5d
so that (10), Sec. 20.3, gives a very large (cid:2)(A),explaining the surprising result in Example 2,
(cid:2)(A)(cid:2)(1.0001(cid:4)1.0000)(5000.5(cid:4)5000.0)(cid:2)20,002. (cid:2)
In practice, A(cid:4)1will not be known, so that in computing the condition number (cid:2)(A),one
must estimate
(cid:5)A(cid:4)1(cid:5).A
method for this (proposed in 1979) is explained in Ref. [E9] listed
in App. 1.
Inaccurate Matrix Entries. (cid:2)(A)can be used for estimating the effect dxof an inaccuracy
dAof A(errors of measurements of the a ,for instance). Instead of Ax (cid:2)bwe then have
jk
(A(cid:4)dA)(x (cid:4)dx)(cid:2)b.
Multiplying out and subtracting Ax (cid:2)b on both sides, we obtain
Adx(cid:4)dA(x (cid:4)dx)(cid:2)0.
Multiplication by
A(cid:4)1
from the left and taking the second term to the right gives
dx(cid:2)(cid:5)A(cid:4)1dA(x(cid:4)dx).
Applying (11) with A(cid:4)1 and vector dA(x (cid:4)dx) instead of A and x, we get
(cid:5)dx(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:5)A(cid:4)1dA(x (cid:4)dx)(cid:5) (cid:11)(cid:5)A(cid:4)1 (cid:5) (cid:5)dA(x(cid:4)dx)(cid:5) .
Applying (11) on the right, with dA and x(cid:5)dx instead of A and x, we obtain
(cid:5)dx(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:5)A(cid:4)1 (cid:5) (cid:5) dA(cid:5) (cid:5)x(cid:4)dx(cid:5).

but this bound is again much greater than the actual inaccuracy, which is about 0.15.
Further Comments on Condition Numbers. The following additional explanations
may be helpful.
1. There is no sharp dividing line between “well-conditioned” and “ill-conditioned,”
but generally the situation will get worse as we go from systems with small (cid:2)(A)to systems
with larger (cid:2)(A). Now always (cid:2)(A)(cid:7)1, so that values of 10 or 20 or so give no reason
for concern, whereas (cid:2)(A)(cid:2)100, say, calls for caution, and systems such as those in
Examples 1 and 2 are extremely ill-conditioned.
2. If (cid:2)(A) is large (or small) in one norm, it will be large (or small, respectively) in
any other norm. See Example 5.
3. The literature on ill-conditioning is extensive. For an introduction to it, see [E9].
This is the end of our discussion of numerics for solving linear systems. In the next section
we consider curve fitting, an important area in which solutions are obtained from linear systems.

Least Squares Method
Having discussed numerics for linear systems, we now turn to an important application,
curve fitting, in which the solutions are obtained from linear systems.
Á
In curve fittingwe are given npoints (pairs of numbers) (x , y ), , (x , y )and we
1 1 n n
want to determine a function f(x) such that
f(x )(cid:2)y ,Á , f(x )(cid:2)y ,
1 1 n n
approximately. The type of function (for example, polynomials, exponential functions,
sine and cosine functions) may be suggested by the nature of the problem (the underlying
physical law, for instance), and in many cases a polynomial of a certain degree will be
appropriate.
Let us begin with a motivation.
If we require strict equality f(x )(cid:2)y ,Á , f(x )(cid:2)y and use polynomials of
1 1 n n
sufficiently high degree, we may apply one of the methods discussed in Sec. 19.3 in
connection with interpolation. However, in certain situations this would not be the
appropriate solution of the actual problem. For instance, to the four points
(1) ((cid:5)1.3, 0.103), ((cid:5)0.1, 1.099), (0.2, 0.808), (1.3, 1.897)
there corresponds the interpolation polynomial f(x)(cid:2)x3(cid:5)x(cid:4)1(Fig. 446), but if we
graph the points, we see that they lie nearly on a straight line. Hence if these values
are obtained in an experiment and thus involve an experimental error, and if the nature
of the experiment suggests a linear relation, we better fit a straight line through
the points (Fig. 446). Such a line may be useful for predicting values to be expected
for other values of x. A widely used principle for fitting straight lines is the method

of least squaresby Gauss and Legendre. In the present situation it may be formulated
as follows.
Method of Least Squares. The straight line

should be fitted through the given points (x , y ), , (x , y )so that the sum of the
1 1 n n
squares of the distances of those points from the straight line is minimum, where
the distance is measured in the vertical direction (the y-direction).
The point on the line with abscissa x has the ordinate a(cid:4)bx . Hence its distance from

(x , y) is ƒy (cid:5)a(cid:5)bx ƒ (Fig. 447) and that sum of squares is

Matrix Eigenvalue Problems: Introduction
We now come to the second part of our chapter on numeric linear algebra. In the first
part of this chapter we discussed methods of solving systems of linear equations, which
included Gauss elimination with backward substitution. This method is known as a direct
method since it gives solutions after a prescribed amount of computation. The Gauss
method was modified by Doolittle’s method, Crout’s method, and Cholesky’s method,
each requiring fewer arithmetic operations than Gauss. Finally we presented indirect
methods of solving systems of linear equations, that is, the Gauss–Seidel method and the
Jacobi iteration. The indirect methods require an undetermined number of iterations. That
number depends on how far we start from the true solution and what degree of accuracy
we require. Moreover, depending on the problem, convergence may be fast or slow or our
computation cycle might not even converge. This led to the concepts of ill-conditioned
problems and condition numbers that help us gain some control over difficulties inherent
in numerics.
The second part of this chapter deals with some of the most important ideas and numeric
methods for matrix eigenvalue problems. This very extensive part of numeric linear algebra
is of great practical importance, with much research going on, and hundreds, if not
thousands, of papers published in various mathematical journals (see the references in
[E8], [E9], [E11], [E29]). We begin with the concepts and general results we shall need
in explaining and applying numeric methods for eigenvalue problems. (For typical models
of eigenvalue problems see Chap. 8.)

SEC. 20.6 Matrix Eigenvalue Problems: Introduction 877
An eigenvalueor characteristic value(or latent root) of a given n(cid:3)nmatrix A(cid:2)[a ]
jk
is a real or complex number l such that the vector equation
(1) Ax (cid:2)lx
has a nontrivial solution, that is, a solution x(cid:6)0,which is then called an eigenvectoror
characteristic vectorof Acorresponding to that eigenvalue l.The set of all eigenvalues
of A is called the spectrum of A. Equation (1) can be written
(2) (A (cid:5)lI)x (cid:2)0
where I is the n(cid:3)n unit matrix. This homogeneous system has a nontrivial solution if
and only if the characteristic determinantdet (A(cid:5)lI)is 0 (see Theorem 2 in Sec. 7.5).
This gives (see Sec. 8.1)

Developing the characteristic determinant, we obtain the characteristic polynomialof A,
which is of degree n in l. Hence A has at least one and at most n numerically different
eigenvalues. If Ais real, so are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. By familiar
algebra it follows that then the roots (the eigenvalues of A) are real or complex conjugates

To give you some orientation of the underlying approaches of numerics for eigenvalue
problems, note the following. For large or very large matrices it may be very difficult to
determine the eigenvalues, since, in general, it is difficult to find the roots of characteristic
polynomials of higher degrees. We will discuss different numeric methods for finding
eigenvalues that achieve different results. Some methods, such as in Sec. 20.7, will give
us only regions in which complex eigenvalues lie (Geschgorin’s method) or the intervals
in which the largest and smallest real eigenvalue lie (Collatz method). Other methods
compute all eigenvalues, such as the Householder tridiagonalization method and the
QR-method in Sec. 20.9.
To continue our discussion, we shall usually denote the eigenvalues of A by
Á
l , l , , l
1 2 n
with the understanding that some (or all) of them may be equal.
The sum of these n eigenvalues equals the sum of the entries on the main diagonal of
A, called the trace of A; thus

Also, the product of the eigenvalues equals the determinant of A,
(5) det A (cid:2)l l Á l .
1 2 n
Both formulas follow from the product representation of the characteristic polynomial,
which we denote by f(l),
f(l)(cid:2)((cid:5)1)n(l(cid:5)l )(l(cid:5)l )Á (l(cid:5)l ).

The exponent m is called the algebraic multiplicity of l. The maximum number of
j j
linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to l is called the geometric multiplicity
j
of l. It is equal to or smaller than m .
j j
A subspace S of Rn or Cn (if A is complex) is called an invariant subspace of A if
for every v in S the vector Av is also in S. Eigenspaces of A (spaces of eigenvectors;
Sec. 8.1) are important invariant subspaces of A.

Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues. If x is an eigenvector of A, then

an eigenvector ofB in (7)corresponding to the same eigenvalue. (Proof
in Sec. 8.4.)
Another theorem that has various applications in numerics is as follows.

The eigenvalues of important special matrices can be characterized as follows.
THEOREM 5 Special Matrices
The eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices (i.e.,AT(cid:2)A),hence of real symmetric matrices
(i.e.,AT(cid:2)A),are real. The eigenvalues of skew-Hermitian matrices (i.e.,AT(cid:2)(cid:5)A),
hence of real skew-symmetric matrices (i.e.,AT(cid:2)(cid:5)A),are pure imaginary or 0.The
eigenvalues of unitary matrices
(i.e.,AT(cid:2)A(cid:4)1),
hence of orthogonal matrices (i.e.,
AT(cid:2)A(cid:4)1),have
absolute value 1.(Proofs in Secs. 8.3 and 8.5.)
The choice of a numeric methodfor matrix eigenvalue problems depends essentially on
two circumstances, on the kind of matrix (real symmetric, real general, complex, sparse,
or full) and on the kind of information to be obtained, that is, whether one wants to know
all eigenvalues or merely specific ones, for instance, the largest eigenvalue, whether
eigenvalues and eigenvectors are wanted, and so on. It is clear that we cannot enter into
a systematic discussion of all these and further possibilities that arise in practice, but we
shall concentrate on some basic aspects and methods that will give us a general
understanding of this fascinating field.
20.7
Inclusion of Matrix Eigenvalues
The whole of numerics for matrix eigenvalues is motivated by the fact that, except for a
few trivial cases, we cannot determine eigenvalues exactlyby a finite process because these
values are the roots of a polynomial of nth degree. Hence we must mainly use iteration.
In this section we state a few general theorems that give approximations and error
bounds for eigenvalues. Our matrices will continue to be real (except in formula (5) below),
but since (nonsymmetric) matrices may have complex eigenvalues, complex numbers will
play a (very modest) role in this section.
The important theorem by Gerschgorin gives a region consisting of closed circular disks
in the complex plane and including all the eigenvalues of a given matrix. Indeed, for each
j(cid:2)1,Á
, n the inequality (1) in the theorem determines a closed circular disk in the
complex l-plane with center a and radius given by the right side of (1); and Theorem 1
jj
states that each of the eigenvalues of A lies in one of these n disks.
THEOREM 1 Gerschgorin’s Theorem6
Let l be an eigenvalue of an arbitrary n(cid:3)n matrix A(cid:2)[a ]. Then for some

Since Ais symmetric, it follows from Theorem 5, Sec. 20.6, that the spectrum of Amust actually lie in the
intervals [(cid:2)1, 2.5]and [3.5, 6.5].
It is interesting that here the Gerschgorin disks form two disjoint sets, namely, D ´ D ,which contains two

THEOREM 2 Extension of Gerschgorin’s Theorem
If p Gerschgorin disks form a set S that is disjoint from the n(cid:2)p other disks of a
given matrixA, then S contains precisely p eigenvalues ofA(each counted with its
algebraic multiplicity, as defined in Sec. 20.6).

EXAMPLE 2 Another Application of Gerschgorin’s Theorem. Similarity
Suppose that we have diagonalized a matrix by some numeric method that left us with some off-diagonal entries
of size 10(cid:2)5,say,
2 10(cid:2)5 10(cid:2)5
A(cid:3) 10(cid:2)5 2 10(cid:2)5 .
10(cid:2)5 10(cid:2)5 4
What can we conclude about deviations of theD eigenvalues from theT main diagonal entries?
Solution. By Theorem 2, one eigenvalue must lie in the disk of radius 2(cid:3)10(cid:2)5 centered at 4 and two
eigenvalues (or an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity 2) in the disk of radius 2(cid:3)10(cid:2)5centered at 2. Actually,
since the matrix is symmetric, these eigenvalues must lie in the intersections of these disks and the real axis,
by Theorem 5 in Sec. 20.6.
We show how an isolated disk can always be reduced in size by a similarity transformation. The matrix

is similar to A. Hence by ThDeorem 2, Sec. 20.6, it hTas the same eigenvalues as A. From Row 3 we get the
smaller disk of radius 2(cid:3)10(cid:2)10.Note that the other disks got bigger, approximately by a factor of 105.And in
choosing Twe have to watch that the new disks do not overlap with the disk whose size we want to decrease.

Further Inclusion Theorems
An inclusion theorem is a theorem that specifies a set which contains at least one
eigenvalue of a given matrix. Thus, Theorems 1 and 2 are inclusion theorems; they even
include the whole spectrum. We now discuss some famous theorems that yield further
inclusions of eigenvalues. We state the first two of them without proofs (which would
exceed the level of this book).

In (4) the second equality sign holds if and only if A is such that
(5) ATA(cid:3)AAT.
Matrices that satisfy (5) are called normal matrices. It is not difficult to see that Hermitian,
skew-Hermitian, and unitary matrices are normal, and so are real symmetric, skew-symmetric,
and orthogonal matrices.

The preceding theorems are valid for every real or complex square matrix. Other theorems
hold for special classes of matrices only. Famous is the following one, which has various
applications, for instance, in economics.
THEOREM 5 Perron’s Theorem8
Let A be a real n(cid:9)n matrix whose entries are all positive. Then A has a positive
real eigenvalue l(cid:3)r of multiplicity 1. The corresponding eigenvector can be
chosen with all components positive. (The other eigenvalues are less than r in
absolute value.)

that ƒlƒ is greater than the absolute values of the other eigenvalues). If Ais symmetric, it

This shows that d is a bound for the error P of the approximation q of an eigenvalue of
A and completes the proof. (cid:2)
The main advantage of the method is its simplicity. And it can handle sparse matrices
too large to store as a full square array. Its disadvantage is its possibly slow convergence.
From the proof of Theorem 1 we see that the speed of convergence depends on the ratio
of the dominant eigenvalue to the next in absolute value (2:1 in Example 1, below).
If we want a convergent sequence of eigenvectors, then at the beginning of each step
we scale the vector, say, by dividing its components by an absolutely largest one, as in
Example 1, as follows.

The error bounds are much larger than the actual errors. This is typical, although the bounds cannot be improved;
that is, for special symmetric matrices they agree with the errors.
Our present results are somewhat better than those of Collatz’s method in Example 4 of Sec. 20.7, at the
(cid:2)
expense of more operations.
Spectral shift, the transition from Ato A(cid:2)kI,shifts every eigenvalue by (cid:2)k.Although
finding a good k can hardly be made automatic, it may be helped by some other method
or small preliminary computational experiments. In Example 1, Gerschgorin’s theorem
gives (cid:2)0.02(cid:4)l(cid:4)0.82for the whole spectrum (verify!). Shifting by (cid:2)0.4might be too
much (then (cid:2)0.42(cid:4)l(cid:4)0.42), so let us try (cid:2)0.2.

Tridiagonalization and QR-Factorization
We consider the problem of computing all the eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix
A(cid:3) a , discussing a method widely used in practice. In the first stage we reduce the
3 jk4
given matrix stepwise to a tridiagonal matrix, that is, a matrix having all its nonzero
entries on the main diagonal and in the positions immediately adjacent to the main diagonal
(such as A in Fig. 450, Third Step). This reduction was invented by A. S. Householder11
3
(J. Assn. Comput. Machinery 5 (1958), 335–342). See also Ref. [E29] in App. 1.
This Householder tridiagonalization will simplify the matrix without changing its
eigenvalues. The latter will then be determined (approximately) by factoring the tridiago-
nalized matrix, as discussed later in this section.

numerical analysis and mathematical biology. He was head of the mathematics division at Oakridge National
Laboratory and later professor at the University of Tennessee. He was both president of ACM (Association for
Computing Machinery) 1954–1956 and SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) 1963–1964.

QR-Factorization Method
In 1958 H. Rutishauser12 of Switzerland proposed the idea of using the LU-factorization
(Sec. 20.2; he called it LR-factorization) in solving eigenvalue problems. An improved
version of Rutishauser’s method (avoiding breakdown if certain submatrices become
singular, etc.; see Ref. [E29]) is the QR-method, independently proposed by the American
J. G. F. Francis (Computer J. 4 (1961–62), 265–271, 332–345) and the Russian V. N.
Kublanovskaya (Zhurnal Vych. Mat. i Mat. Fiz.1(1961), 555–570). The QR-method uses
the factorization QRwith orthogonal Qand upper triangular R.We discuss the QR-method
for a real symmetricmatrix. (For extensions to general matrices see Ref. [E29] in App. 1.)
In this method we first transform a given real symmetric n(cid:9)n matrix A into a
tridiagonal matrix B (cid:3)B by Householder’s method. This creates many zeros and thus

Looking back at our discussion, we recognize that the purpose of applying Householder’s
tridiagonalization before the QR-factorization method is a substantial reduction of cost in
each QR-factorization, in particular if A is large.
Convergence acceleration and thus further reduction of cost can be achieved by a
spectral shift,that is, by taking B (cid:2)k Iinstead of B with a suitable k .Possible choices

Numeric Linear Algebra
Main tasks are the numeric solution of linear systems (Secs. 20.1–20.4), curve fitting
(Sec. 20.5), and eigenvalue problems (Secs. 20.6–20.9).

can be solved by a direct method(one in which the number of numeric operations
can be specified in advance, e.g., Gauss’s elimination) or by an indirector iterative
method (in which an initial approximation is improved stepwise).
The Gauss elimination (Sec. 20.1) is direct, namely, a systematic elimination
process that reduces (1) stepwise to triangular form. In Step 1 we eliminate x from
1
equations E to E by subtracting (a a ) E from E , then (a a ) E from
2 n 21> 11 1 2 31> 11 1
E , etc. Equation E is called the pivot equation in this step and a the pivot. In
3 1 11
Step 2 we take the new second equation as pivot equation and eliminate x , etc. If
2
the triangular form is reached, we get x from the last equation, then x from
n n(cid:2)1
the second last, etc. Partial pivoting ((cid:2)interchange of equations) is necessary if
candidates for pivots are zero, and advisable if they are small in absolute value.
Doolittle’s, Crout’s, and Cholesky’s methods in Sec. 20.2 are variants of the
Gauss elimination. They factor A(cid:2)LU (L lower triangular, U upper triangular)
and solve Ax(cid:2)LUx(cid:2)b by solving Ly(cid:2)b for y and then Ux(cid:2)y for x.
In the Gauss–Seidel iteration(Sec. 20.3) we make a (cid:2)a (cid:2) Á (cid:2)a (cid:2)1
11 22 nn
(by division) and write Ax(cid:2)(I (cid:6)L(cid:6)U)x (cid:2)b; thus x(cid:2)b(cid:3)(L (cid:6)U)x, which
suggests the iteration formula
(2) x(m(cid:6)1)(cid:2)b(cid:3)Lx(m(cid:6)1) (cid:3)Ux(m)
in which we always take the most recent approximate x ’s on the right. If (cid:2)C(cid:2)(cid:7)1,
j
where C(cid:2)(cid:3)(I (cid:6)L)(cid:2)1U, then this process converges. Here, (cid:2)C(cid:2) denotes any
matrix norm (Sec. 20.3).

Numerics for ODEs and PDEs
Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) play a
central role in modeling problems of engineering, mathematics, physics, aeronautics,
astronomy, dynamics, elasticity, biology, medicine, chemistry, environmental science,
economics, and many other areas. Chapters 1–6 and 12 explained the major approaches
to solving ODEs and PDEs analytically. However, in your career as an engineer, applied
mathematicians, or physicist you will encounter ODEs and PDEs that cannot be solved
by those analytic methods or whose solutions are so difficult that other approaches are
needed. It is precisely in these real-world projects that numeric methods for ODEs and
PDEs are used, often as part of a software package. Indeed, numeric software has become
an indispensable tool for the engineer.
This chapter is evenly divided between numerics for ODEs and numerics for PDEs.
We start with ODEs and discuss, in Sec. 21.1, methods for first-order ODEs. The main
initial idea is that we can obtain approximations to the solution of such an ODE at points
that are a distance hapart by using the first two terms of Taylor’s formula from calculus.
We use these approximations to construct the iteration formula for a method known as
Euler’s method. While this method is rather unstable and of little practical use, it serves
as a pedagogical tool and a starting point toward understanding more sophisticated methods
such as the Runge–Kutta method and its variant the Runga–Kutta–Fehlberg (RKF) method,
which are popular and useful in practice. As is usual in mathematics, one tends to
generalize mathematical ideas. The methods of Sec. 21.1 are one-step methods, that is,
the current approximation uses only the approximation from the previous step. Multistep
methods, such as the Adams–Bashforth methods and Adams–Moulton methods, use values
computed from several previous steps. We conclude numerics for ODEs with applying
Runge–Kutta–Nyström methods and other methods to higher order ODEs and systems of
ODEs.
Numerics for PDEs are perhaps even more exciting and ingenious than those for ODEs.
We first consider PDEs of the elliptic type (Laplace, Poisson). Again, Taylor’s formula
serves as a starting point and lets us replace partial derivatives by difference quotients.
The end result leads to a mesh and an evaluation scheme that uses the Gauss–Seidel
method (here also know as Liebmann’s method). We continue with methods that use grids
to solve Neuman and mixed problems (Sec. 21.5) and conclude with the important
Crank–Nicholson method for parabolic PDEs in Sec. 21.6.
Sections 21.1 and 21.2 may be studied immediately after Chap. 1 and Sec. 21.3
immediately after Chaps.2–4,because these sections are independent of Chaps. 19 and 20.
Sections 21.4–21.7 on PDEs may be studied immediately after Chap. 12 if students
have some knowledge of linear systems of algebraic equations.

21.1
Methods for First-Order ODEs
Take a look at Sec. 1.2, where we briefly introduced Euler’s method with an example.
We shall develop Euler’s method more rigorously. Pay close attention to the derivation
that uses Taylor’s formula from calculus to approximate the solution to a first-order ODE
at points that are a distance hapart. If you understand this approach, which is typical for
numerics for ODEs, then you will understand other methods more easily.
From Chap. 1 we know that an ODE of the first order is of the form F(x, y, yr )(cid:3)0
and can often be written in the explicit form yr (cid:3)f(x, y). An initial value problem for
this equation is of the form
(1) yr (cid:3)f(x, y), y(x )(cid:3)y
0 0
where x and y are given and we assume that the problem has a unique solution on some
0 0
open interval a(cid:4)x(cid:4)b containing x .
0
In this section we shall discuss methods of computing approximate numeric values of
the solution y(x) of (1) at the equidistant points on the x-axis
x (cid:3)x (cid:2)h, x (cid:3)x (cid:2)2h, x (cid:3)x (cid:2)3h, Á
1 0 2 0 3 0
where the step sizehis a fixed number, for instance, 0.2 or 0.1 or 0.01, whose choice we
discuss later in this section. Those methods are step-by-step methods, using the same
formula in each step. Such formulas are suggested by the Taylor series
(2) y(x(cid:2)h)(cid:3)y(x)(cid:2)hyr (x) (cid:2)
h2
ys (x)(cid:2) Á .
2
Formula (2) is the key idea that lets us develop Euler’s method and its variant called—
you guessed it—improved Euler method, also known as Heun’s method. Let us start by
deriving Euler’s method.
For small h the higher powers h2, h3,Á in (2) are very small. Dropping all of them
gives the crude approximation
y(x(cid:2)h)(cid:2)y(x)(cid:2)hyr
(x)
(cid:3)y(x)(cid:2)hf(x, y)
and the corresponding Euler method (or Euler–Cauchy method)
(3) y (cid:3)y (cid:2)hf(x , y ) (n(cid:3)0, 1,Á )
n(cid:2)1 n n n
discussed in Sec. 1.2. Geometrically, this is an approximation of the curve of y(x) by a
polygon whose first side is tangent to this curve at x (see Fig. 8 in Sec. 1.2).

Error of the Euler Method. Recall from calculus that Taylor’s formula with
remainder has the form
y(x(cid:2)h)(cid:3)y(x) (cid:2)hyr (x)(cid:2) 1 h2ys ((cid:2))

(where x(cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:7)x(cid:2)h). It shows that, in the Euler method, the truncation error in each
stepor local truncation erroris proportional to h2,written O(h2),where Osuggests order
(see also Sec. 20.1). Now, over a fixed x-interval in which we want to solve an ODE, the
number of steps is proportional to 1 h.Hence the total erroror global erroris proportional

to h2(1 h)(cid:3)h1. For this reason, the Euler method is called a first-order method. In

addition, there are roundoff errors in this and other methods, which may affect the

accuracy of the values y , y , more and more as n increases.

Automatic Variable Step Size Selection in Modern Software. The idea of
adaptive integration, as motivated and explained in Sec. 19.5, applies equally well to the
numeric solution of ODEs. It now concerns automatically changing the step size hdepending

Accordingly, modern software automatically selects variable step sizes h so that the error

the Euler method, when the step size is h(cid:3)h ,the local error at x is about 1h2 ƒys ((cid:2) )ƒ.

Improved Euler Method. Predictor, Corrector. Euler’s method is generally much
too inaccurate. For a large h(0.2) this is illustrated in Sec. 1.2 by the computation for
(6) yr (cid:3)y(cid:2)x, y(0) (cid:3)0.
And for small h the computation becomes prohibitive; also, roundoff in so many steps
may result in meaningless results. Clearly, methods of higher order and precision are
obtained by taking more terms in (2) into account. But this involves an important practical
problem. Namely, if we substitute yr (cid:3)f(x, y(x)) into (2), we have
(2*) y(x(cid:2)h)(cid:3)y(x)(cid:2)hf (cid:2)1h2fr (cid:2)1h3 fs (cid:2) Á .

Now yin fdepends on x, so that we have f as shown in (4*)and f , f even much more
cumbersome. The general strategy now is to avoid the computation of these derivatives
and to replace it by computing f for one or several suitably chosen auxiliary values of
(x, y). “Suitably” means that these values are chosen to make the order of the method as

high as possible (to have high accuracy). Let us discuss two such methods that are of
practical importance, namely, the improved Euler method and the (classical) Runge–Kutta
method.
In each step of the improved Euler method we computetwovalues, first thepredictor

Hence the improved Euler method is a predictor–corrector method: In each step we predict
a value (7a) and then we correct it by (7b).

Since the Euler method was an attractive pedagogical tool to teach the beginning of
solving first-order ODEs numerically but had its drawbacks in terms of accuracy and could
even produce wrong answers, we studied the improved Euler method and thereby
introduced the idea of a predictor–corrector method. Although improved Euler is better
than Euler, there are better methods that are used in industrial settings. Thus the practicing
engineer has to know about the Runga–Kutta methods and its variants.
Runge–Kutta Methods (RK Methods)
A method of great practical importance and much greater accuracy than that of the
improved Euler method is the classical Runge–Kutta method of fourth order, which we
c21-a.qxd 11/9/10 7:40 PM Page 905
SEC. 21.1 Methods for First-Order ODEs 905
call briefly the Runge–Kutta method.1 It is shown in Table 21.3. We see that in each
step we first compute four auxiliary quantities k , k , k , k and then the new value y .
1 2 3 4 n(cid:2)1
The method is well suited to the computer because it needs no special starting procedure,
makes light demand on storage, and repeatedly uses the same straightforward compu-
tational procedure. It is numerically stable.
Note that, if fdepends only on x, this method reduces to Simpson’s rule of integration
Á
(Sec. 19.5). Note further that k , , k depend on n and generally change from step
1 4
to step.

method in Table 21.3 is most popular from a practical viewpoint because of its “symmetrical” form and its
simple coefficients. It was given by Kutta.

Error and Step Size Control.
RKF (Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg)
The idea of adaptive integration (Sec. 19.5) has analogs for Runge–Kutta (and other)
methods. In Table 21.3 for RK (Runge–Kutta), if we compute in each step approximations
(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2)
yand y with step sizes hand 2h, respectively, the latter has error per step equal to 25(cid:3)32
times that of the former; however, since we have only half as many steps for 2h, the actual
factor is 25 2(cid:3)16, so that, say,
>
P(2h)(cid:2)16P(h) and thus y(h)(cid:8)y(2h)(cid:3)P(2h)(cid:8)P(h)(cid:2)(16 (cid:8)1)P(h).
c21-a.qxd 11/3/10 2:44 PM Page 907
SEC. 21.1 Methods for First-Order ODEs 907
Hence the error P(cid:3)P(h) for step size h is about
(10) P(cid:3) 1 ( (cid:2) y (cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:2) y)
15
where (cid:2) y(cid:8)(cid:2)(cid:2) y (cid:3)y(h)(cid:8)y(2h),as said before. Table 21.6 illustrates (10) for the initial value

(11) yr (cid:3)(y(cid:8)x(cid:8)1)2(cid:2)2, y(0) (cid:3)1,
the step size h(cid:3)0.1 and 0(cid:7)x(cid:7)0.4. We see that the estimate is close to the actual
error. This method of error estimation is simple but may be unstable.

RKF. E. Fehlberg [Computing 6 (1970), 61–71] proposed and developed error control
by using two RK methods of different orders to go from (x , y ) to (x , y ). The
n n n(cid:2)1 n(cid:2)1
difference of the computed y-values at x gives an error estimate to be used for step

evaluations per step. We present these formulas here because RKF has become quite
popular. For instance, Maple uses it (also for systems of ODEs).

Table 21.7 summarizes essential features of the methods in this section. It can be shown
that these methods are numerically stable (definition in Sec. 19.1). They are one-step
methods because in each step we use the data of just one preceding step, in contrast to
multistep methods where in each step we use data from several preceding steps, as we
shall see in the next section.

Backward Euler Method. Stiff ODEs
The backward Euler formula for numerically solving (1) is
(16) y (cid:3)y (cid:2)hf(x , y ) (n(cid:3)0, 1,Á ).
n(cid:2)1 n n(cid:2)1 n(cid:2)1
This formula is obtained by evaluating the right side at the new location (x , y );
n(cid:2)1 n(cid:2)1
this is called the backward Euler scheme. For known y it gives y implicitly, so it
n n(cid:2)1
defines an implicit method, in contrast to the Euler method (3), which gives y
n(cid:2)1
explicitly. Hence (16) must be solved for y . How difficult this is depends on f in (1).
n(cid:2)1
For a linear ODE this provides no problem, as Example 4 (below) illustrates. The method
is particularly useful for “stiff” ODEs, as they occur quite frequently in the study of
vibrations, electric circuits, chemical reactions, etc. The situation of stiffness is roughly
as follows; for details, see, for example, [E5], [E25], [E26] in App. 1.
Error terms of the methods considered so far involve a higher derivative. And we ask
what happens if we let h increase.Now if the error (the derivative) grows fast but the desired
solution also grows fast, nothing will happen. However, if that solution does not grow fast,
then with growing hthe error term can take over to an extent that the numeric result becomes
completely nonsensical, as in Fig. 451. Such an ODE for which h must thus be restricted
to small values, and the physical system the ODE models, are called stiff. This term is
suggested by a mass–spring system with a stiff spring (spring with a large k; see Sec. 2.4).
Example 4 illustrates that implicit methods remove the difficulty of increasing hin the case
of stiffness: It can be shown that in the application of an implicit method the solution remains
stable under any increase of h, although the accuracy decreases with increasing h.
EXAMPLE 4 Backward Euler Method. Stiff ODE
The initial value problem
yr(cid:3)f(x, y)(cid:3)(cid:8)20hy(cid:2)20x2(cid:2)2x, y(0)(cid:3)1

The numeric results in Table 21.8 show the following.
Stability of the backward Euler method for h(cid:3)0.05and also for h(cid:3)0.2with an error increase by about a
factor 4 for h(cid:3)0.2,
Stability of the Euler method for h(cid:3)0.05but instability for h(cid:3)0.1(Fig. 451),
Stability of RK for h(cid:3)0.1but instability for h(cid:3)0.2.
This illustrates that the ODE is stiff. Note that even in the case of stability the approximation of the solution
near x(cid:3)0 is poor. (cid:2)
Stiffness will be considered further in Sec. 21.3 in connection with systems of ODEs.

Multistep Methods
In a one-step method we compute y using only a single step, namely, the previous
n(cid:2)1
value y . One-step methods are “self-starting,” they need no help to get going because
n
they obtain y from the initial value y , etc. All methods in Sec. 21.1 are one-step.
1 0
In contrast, a multistep method uses, in each step, values from two or more previous
steps. These methods are motivated by the expectation that the additional information will
increase accuracy and stability. But to get started, one needs values, say, y , y , y , y in
0 1 2 3
a 4-step method, obtained by Runge–Kutta or another accurate method. Thus, multistep
methods are not self-starting. Such methods are obtained as follows.
Adams–Bashforth Methods
We consider an initial value problem
(1) yr (cid:3)f(x, y), y(x )(cid:3)y
0 0
as before, with f such that the problem has a unique solution on some open interval
containing x . We integrate yr(cid:3)f(x, y) from x to x (cid:3)x (cid:2)h. This gives

n(cid:2)1 n
xn xn
Now comes the main idea. We replace f(x, y(x))by an interpolation polynomial p(x)(see
Sec. 19.3), so that we can later integrate. This gives approximations y of y(x )and

Different choices of p(x) will now produce different methods. We explain the principle
by taking a cubic polynomial, namely, the polynomial p (x) that at (equidistant)

f (cid:3)f(x , y ).
n(cid:3)3 n(cid:3)3 n(cid:3)3
This will lead to a practically useful formula. We can obtain p (x) from Newton’s
3
backward difference formula (18), Sec. 19.3:
p (x)(cid:3)f (cid:2)r(cid:11)f (cid:2)1r(r (cid:2)1)(cid:11)2f (cid:2)1r(r (cid:2)1)(r (cid:2)2)(cid:11)3f

We integrate p (x) over x from x to x (cid:3)x (cid:2)h, thus over r from 0 to 1. Since

The integral of 1r(r (cid:2)1) is 5 and that of 1r(r (cid:2)1)(r (cid:2)2) is 3. We thus obtain

It expresses the new value y [approximation of the solution yof (1) at x ] in terms
n(cid:2)1 n(cid:2)1
of 4 values of f computed from the y-values obtained in the preceding 4 steps. The local
truncation error is of order h5, as can be shown, so that the global error is of order h4;
hence (5) does define a fourth-order method.
Adams–Moulton Methods
Adams–Moulton methods are obtained if for p(x) in (2) we choose a polynomial that

interpolates f(x, y(x))at x , x , x , (as opposed to x , x , used before; this
n(cid:2)1 n n(cid:3)1 n n(cid:3)1(cid:2)

at x , x , x , x . (Before we had x , x , x , x .) Again using (18) in

This is usually called an Adams–Moulton formula.3 It is an implicit formula because
f (cid:3)f(x , y ) appears on the right, so that it defines y only implicitly, in
n(cid:2)1 n(cid:2)1 n(cid:2)1 n(cid:2)1
contrast to (5), which is an explicit formula, not involving y on the right. To use (6)

The corrected new value y is then obtained from (6) with f replaced by
n(cid:2)1 n(cid:2)1
f* (cid:3)f(x , y* ) and the other f’s as in (6); thus,

This predictor–corrector method (7a), (7b) is usually called the Adams–Moulton
method of fourth order. It has the advantage over RK that (7) gives the error estimate

as can be shown. This is the analog of (10) in Sec. 21.1.

Sometimes the name Adams–Moulton method is reserved for the method with several
corrections per step by (7b) until a specific accuracy is reached. Popular codes exist for
both versions of the method.
Getting Started. In (5) we need f , f , f , f . Hence from (3) we see that we must first
0 1 2 3
compute y , y , y by some other method of comparable accuracy, for instance, by RK or
1 2 3
by RKF. For other choices see Ref. [E26] listed in App. 1.
EXAMPLE 1 Adams–Bashforth Prediction (7a), Adams–Moulton Correction (7b)

Solution. The problem is the same as in Examples 1 and 2, Sec. 21.1, so that we can compare the results.
We compute starting values y , y , y by the classical Runge–Kutta method. Then in each step we predict
1 2 3
by (7a) and make one correction by (7b) before we execute the next step. The results are shown and compared
with the exact values in Table 21.9. We see that the corrections improve the accuracy considerably. This is
(cid:2)
typical.

Comments on Comparison of Methods. An Adams–Moulton formula is generally
much more accurate than an Adams–Bashforth formula of the same order. This justifies
the greater complication and expense in using the former. The method (7a), (7b) is
numerically stable, whereas the exclusive use of (7a) might cause instability. Step size
control is relatively simple. If ƒCorrector(cid:8)Predictorƒ (cid:6)TOL, use interpolation to
generate “old” results at half the current step size and then try h 2 as the new step.
>
Whereas the Adams–Moulton formula (7a), (7b) needs only 2 evaluations per step,
Runge–Kutta needs 4; however, with Runge–Kutta one may be able to take a step size
more than twice as large, so that a comparison of this kind (widespread in the literature)
is meaningless.

problems for single mth-order ODEs,
(2) y(m)(cid:3)f(x, y, yr , ys ,Á , y(m(cid:3)1))
and initial conditions y(x )(cid:3)K , yr (x )(cid:3)K ,Á , y(m(cid:3)1)(x )(cid:3)K as special cases.

Indeed, the connection is achieved by setting

Euler Method for Systems
Methods for single first-order ODEs can be extended to systems (1) simply by writing vector
functions yand finstead of scalar functions yand f, whereas xremains a scalar variable.
We begin with the Euler method. Just as for a single ODE, this method will not be
accurate enough for practical purposes, but it nicely illustrates the extension principle.
EXAMPLE 1 Euler Method for a Second-Order ODE. Mass–Spring System
Solve the initial value problem for a damped mass–spring system
ys(cid:2)2yr(cid:2)0.75y(cid:3)0, y(0)(cid:3)3, yr (0)(cid:3)(cid:8)2.5
by the Euler method for systems with step h(cid:3)0.2for xfrom 0 to 1 (where xis time).
Solution. The Euler method(3), Sec. 21.1, generalizes to systems in the form
(5) y n(cid:2)1(cid:3)y n(cid:2)hf(x n, y n),
in components
y 1,n(cid:2)1(cid:3)y 1,n(cid:2)hf 1(x n, y 1,n, y 2,n)
y 2,n(cid:2)1(cid:3)y 2,n(cid:2)hf 2(x n, y 1,n, y 2,n)
and similarly for systems of more than two equations. By (4) the given ODE converts to the system
yr(cid:3)f (x, y , y )(cid:3)y
1 1 1 2 2
yr(cid:3)f (x, y , y )(cid:3)(cid:8)2y (cid:8)0.75y .

c21-a.qxd 11/3/10 2:44 PM Page 917
SEC. 21.3 Methods for Systems and Higher Order ODEs 917
Hence (5) becomes
y 1,n(cid:2)1(cid:3)y 1,n(cid:2)0.2y
2,n
y 2,n(cid:2)1(cid:3)y 2,n(cid:2)0.2((cid:8)2y 2,n(cid:8)0.75y 1,n).
The initial conditions are y(0)(cid:3)y (0)(cid:3)3, yr (0)(cid:3)y (0)(cid:3)(cid:8)2.5.The calculations are shown in Table 21.10.

As for single ODEs, the results would not be accurate enough for practical purposes. The example merely serves
to illustrate the method because the problem can be readily solved exactly,
y(cid:3)y (cid:3)2e(cid:3)0.5x(cid:2)e(cid:3)1.5x, thus yr(cid:3)y (cid:3)(cid:8)e(cid:3)0.5x(cid:8)1.5e(cid:3)1.5x. (cid:2)

Runge–Kutta Methods for Systems
As for Euler methods, we obtain RK methods for an initial value problem (1) simply by
writing vector formulas for vectors with m components, which, for m(cid:3)1, reduce to the
previous scalar formulas.
Thus, for the classical RK method of fourth order in Table 21.3, we obtain
(6a) y(x )(cid:3)y (Initial values)

and for each step n(cid:3)0, 1,Á , N(cid:8)1 we obtain the 4 auxiliary quantities

optics (see Ref. [A13], p. 188, listed in App. 1). (cid:13)is the gamma function (see App. A3.1). The initial conditions
are such that we obtain a standard solution, the Airy functionAi(x),a special function that has been thoroughly
investigated; for numeric values, see Ref. [GenRef1], pp. 446, 475.

Hence f(cid:3)[ f f ]Tin (1) has the components f (x, y)(cid:3)y , f (x, y)(cid:3)xy .We now write (6) in components.

The initial conditions (6a) are y (cid:3)0.35502805, y (cid:3)(cid:8)0.25881940.In (6b) we have fewer subscripts by
1,0 2,0
simply writing k (cid:3)a, k (cid:3)b, k (cid:3)c, k (cid:3)d,so that a(cid:3)[a a ]T,etc. Then (6b) takes the form

Runge–Kutta–Nyström Methods (RKN Methods)

ODEs
ys(cid:3)f(x,

),as given by the Finnish mathematician E. J. Nyström [Acta Soc. Sci.
fenn., 1925, L, No. 13]. The best known of these uses the following formulas, where
n(cid:3)0, 1,Á , N(cid:8)1(Nthe number of steps):
k (cid:3)1hf(x , y , yr )

Our work in Examples 2 and 3 also illustrates that usefulness of methods for ODEs in the
computation of values of “higher transcendental functions.”
Backward Euler Method for Systems. Stiff Systems
The backward Euler formula (16) in Sec. 21.1 generalizes to systems in the form
(8) y (cid:3)y (cid:2)h f(x , y ) (n(cid:3)0, 1,Á ).
n(cid:2)1 n n(cid:2)1 n(cid:2)1
This is again an implicit method, giving y implicitly for given y .Hence (8) must be
n(cid:2)1 n
solved for y .For a linear system this is shown in the next example. This example also
n(cid:2)1
illustrates that, similar to the case of a single ODE in Sec. 21.1, the method is very useful
for stiff systems. These are systems of ODEs whose matrix has eigenvalues l of very
different magnitudes, having the effect that, just as in Sec. 21.1, the step in direct methods,
RK for example, cannot be increased beyond a certain threshold without losing stability.
(l(cid:3)(cid:8)1 and (cid:8)10 in Example 4, but larger differences do occur in applications.)
EXAMPLE 4 Backward Euler Method for Systems of ODEs. Stiff Systems
Compare the backward Euler method (8) with the Euler and the RK methods for numerically solving the initial
value problem
ys(cid:2)11yr(cid:2)10y(cid:3)10x(cid:2)11, y(0)(cid:3)2, yr (0)(cid:3)(cid:8)10
converted to a system of first-order ODEs.
Solution. The given problem can easily be solved, obtaining
y(cid:3)e(cid:3)x(cid:2)e(cid:3)10x(cid:2)x
so that we can compute errors. Conversion to a system by setting y(cid:3)y , yr(cid:3)y [see (4)] gives

Methods for Elliptic PDEs
We have arrived at the second half of this chapter, which is devoted to numerics for
partial differential equations (PDEs). As we have seen in Chap.12, there are many
applications to PDEs, such as in dynamics, elasticity, heat transfer, electromagnetic
theory, quantum mechanics, and others. Selected because of their importance in
applications, the PDEs covered here include the Laplace equation, the Poisson equation,
the heat equation, and the wave equation. By covering these equations based on their
importance in applications we also selected equations that are important for theoretical
considerations. Indeed, these equations serve as models for elliptic, parabolic, and
hyperbolic PDEs. For example, the Laplace equation is a representative example of an
elliptic type of PDE, and so forth.
c21-b.qxd 11/3/10 2:53 PM Page 923
SEC. 21.4 Methods for Elliptic PDEs 923
Recall, from Sec. 12.4, that a PDE is called quasilinear if it is linear in the highest
derivatives. Hence a second-order quasilinear PDE in two independent variables x, yis of the
form
(1) au (cid:4)2bu (cid:4)cu (cid:3)F(x, y, u, u , u ).
xx xy yy x y
u is an unknown function of x and y (a solution sought). F is a given function of the
indicated variables.
Depending on the discriminant ac(cid:2)b2, the PDE (1) is said to be of
elliptic type if ac(cid:2)b2(cid:7)0 (example: Laplace equation)
parabolic type if ac(cid:2)b2(cid:3)0 (example: heat equation)
hyperbolic type if ac(cid:2)b2(cid:6)0 (example: wave equation).
Here, in the heat and wave equations, yis time t. The coefficients a, b, cmay be functions
of x, y, so that the type of (1) may be different in different regions of the xy-plane. This
classification is not merely a formal matter but is of great practical importance because
the general behavior of solutions differs from type to type and so do the additional
conditions (boundary and initial conditions) that must be taken into account.
Applications involving elliptic equationsusually lead to boundary value problems in a
region R, called a first boundary value problem or Dirichlet problem if u is prescribed
on the boundary curve C of R, a second boundary value problem or Neumann problem
if u (cid:3) 0u 0n(normal derivative of u) is prescribed on C, and a thirdor mixed problem
n >
if uis prescribed on a part of Cand u on the remaining part. Cusually is a closed curve
n
(or sometimes consists of two or more such curves).
Difference Equations
for the Laplace and Poisson Equations
In this section we develop numeric methods for the two most important elliptic PDEs that
appear in applications. The two PDEs are the Laplace equation
(2)
(cid:5)2u(cid:3)u xx(cid:4)u yy(cid:3)0
and the Poisson equation
(3) (cid:5)2u(cid:3)u xx(cid:4)u yy(cid:3)f (x, y).
The starting point for developing our numeric methods is the idea that we can replace
the partial derivatives of these PDEs by corresponding difference quotients. Details are
as follows:
To develop this idea, we start with the Taylor formula and obtain
(a) u(x(cid:4)h, y)(cid:3)u(x, y) (cid:4)hu (x, y) (cid:4)1h2u (x, y) (cid:4)1h3u (x, y) (cid:4) Á

x 2 xx 6 xxx
c21-b.qxd 11/3/10 2:53 PM Page 924

We subtract (4b) from (4a), neglect terms in h3, h4,Á , and solve for u . Then
x

(5a) u (x, y) (cid:2) u(x(cid:4)h, y)(cid:2)u(x(cid:2)h, y) .

and
u(x, y(cid:2)k)(cid:3)u(x, y) (cid:2)ku (x, y) (cid:4)1k2u (x, y) (cid:4)Á .

By subtracting, neglecting terms in k3, k4,Á , and solving for u we obtain

We now turn to second derivatives. Adding (4a) and (4b) and neglecting terms in
h4, h5,Á ,we obtain u(x(cid:4)h, y)(cid:4)u(x(cid:2)h, y)(cid:2)2u(x, y) (cid:4)h2u (x, y).Solving for u

Figure 453a shows the points (x(cid:4)h, y), (x (cid:2)h, y),Á in (5) and (6).
We now substitute (6a) and (6b) into the Poisson equation(3), choosing k(cid:3)hto obtain
a simple formula:
(7) u(x(cid:4)h, y)(cid:4)u(x, y(cid:4)h)(cid:4)u(x(cid:2)h, y)(cid:4)u(x, y(cid:2)h)(cid:2)4u(x, y) (cid:3)h2f(x, y).
This is a difference equation corresponding to (3). Hence for the Laplace equation (2)
the corresponding difference equation is
(8) u(x(cid:4)h, y)(cid:4)u(x, y(cid:4)h)(cid:4)u(x(cid:2)h, y)(cid:4)u(x, y(cid:2)h)(cid:2)4u(x, y) (cid:3)0.
his called the mesh size. Equation (8) relates uat (x, y)to uat the four neighboring points
shown in Fig. 453b. It has a remarkable interpretation: u at (x, y) equals the mean of the
c21-b.qxd 11/3/10 2:53 PM Page 925

values of u at the four neighboring points. This is an analog of the mean value property
of harmonic functions (Sec. 18.6).
Those neighbors are often called E(East), N(North), W(West), S(South). Then Fig. 453b
becomes Fig. 453c and (7) is

Dirichlet Problem
In numerics for the Dirichlet problem in a region Rwe choose an hand introduce a square
grid of horizontal and vertical straight lines of distance h. Their intersections are called
mesh points (or lattice points or nodes). See Fig. 454.
Then we approximate the given PDE by a difference equation [(8) for the Laplace
equation], which relates the unknown values of u at the mesh points in R to each other
and to the given boundary values (details in Example 1). This gives a linear system of
algebraic equations. By solving it we get approximations of the unknown values of u at
the mesh points in R.
We shall see that the number of equations equals the number of unknowns. Now comes
an important point. If the number of internal mesh points, call it p, is small, say, p(cid:6)100,
then a direct solution method may be applied to that linear system of p(cid:6)100 equations
in p unknowns. However, if p is large, a storage problem will arise. Now since each
unknown u is related to only 4 of its neighbors, the coefficient matrix of the system is a
sparse matrix, that is, a matrix with relatively few nonzero entries (for instance, 500 of
10,000 when p(cid:3)100). Hence for large p we may avoid storage difficulties by using an
iteration method, notably the Gauss–Seidel method (Sec. 20.3), which in PDEs is also
c21-b.qxd 11/3/10 2:53 PM Page 926
926 CHAP. 21 Numerics for ODEs and PDEs
called Liebmann’s method (note the strict diagonal dominance). Remember that in this
method we have the storage convenience that we can overwrite any solution component
(value of u) as soon as a “new” value is available.
Both cases, large p and small p, are of interest to the engineer, large p if a fine grid is
used to achieve high accuracy, and small pif the boundary values are known only rather
inaccurately, so that a coarse grid will do it because in this case it would be meaningless
to try for great accuracy in the interior of the region R.
We illustrate this approach with an example, keeping the number of equations small,
for simplicity. As convenient notations for mesh points and corresponding values of the
solution (and of approximate solutions) we use (see also Fig. 454)
(10) P (cid:3)(ih, jh), u (cid:3)u(ih, jh).

Remark. Our current discussion and the example that follows illustrate what we may
call the reuseability of mathematical ideas and methods. Recall that we applied the
Gauss–Seidel method to a system of ODEs in Sec. 20.3 and that we can now apply it
again to elliptic PDEs. This shows that engineering mathematics has a structure and
important mathematical ideas and methods will appear again and again in different
situations. The student should find this attractive in that previous knowledge can be
reapplied.
EXAMPLE 1 Laplace Equation. Liebmann’s Method
The four sides of a square plate of side 12 cm, made of homogeneous material, are kept at constant temperature
0°Cand 100°Cas shown in Fig. 455a. Using a (very wide) grid of mesh 4 cm and applying Liebmann’s method
(that is, Gauss–Seidel iteration), find the (steady-state) temperature at the mesh points.
Solution. In the case of independence of time, the heat equation (see Sec. 10.8)
u (cid:3)c2(u (cid:4)u )
t xx yy
reduces to the Laplace equation. Hence our problem is a Dirichlet problem for the latter. We choose the grid
shown in Fig. 455b and consider the mesh points in the order P , P , P , P .We use (11) and, in each equation,
11 21 12 22
take to the right all the terms resulting from the given boundary values. Then we obtain the system

21 12 22
In practice, one would solve such a small system by the Gauss elimination, finding u (cid:3)u (cid:3)87.5,
11 21
u (cid:3)u (cid:3)62.5.
12 22
More exact values (exact to 3S) of the solution of the actual problem [as opposed to its model (12)] are 88.1
and 61.9, respectively. (These were obtained by using Fourier series.) Hence the error is about 1%,which is
surprisingly accurate for a grid of such a large mesh size h. If the system of equations were large, one would
solve it by an indirect method, such as Liebmann’s method. For (12) this is as follows. We write (12) in the
form (divide by (cid:2)4and take terms to the right)
u (cid:3) 0.25u (cid:4)0.25u (cid:4)50
11 21 12
u (cid:3)0.25u (cid:4)0.25u (cid:4)50

u (cid:3)0.25u (cid:4)0.25u (cid:4)25
12 11 22
u (cid:3) 0.25u (cid:4)0.25u (cid:4)25.
22 21 12
These equations are now used for the Gauss–Seidel iteration. They are identical with (2) in Sec. 20.3, where
u (cid:3)x , u (cid:3)x , u (cid:3)x , u (cid:3)x ,and the iteration is explained there, with 100, 100, 100, 100 chosen as
11 1 21 2 12 3 22 4
starting values. Some work can be saved by better starting values, usually by taking the average of the boundary
values that enter into the linear system. The exact solution of the system is u (cid:3)u (cid:3)87.5,u (cid:3)u (cid:3)62.5,

is an (n(cid:2)1)(cid:8)(n(cid:2)1)matrix. (In (12) we have n(cid:3)3, (n(cid:2)1)2(cid:3)4internal mesh points, two submatrices
B, and two submatrices I.) The matrix Ais nonsingular. This follows by noting that the off-diagonal entries in
each row of Ahave the sum 3 (or 2), whereas each diagonal entry of Aequals (cid:2)4,so that nonsingularity is
(cid:2)
implied by Gerschgorin’s theorem in Sec. 20.7 because no Gerschgorin disk can include 0.
A matrix is called a band matrix if it has all its nonzero entries on the main diagonal
and on sloping lines parallel to it (separated by sloping lines of zeros or not). For example,
Ain (13) is a band matrix. Although the Gauss elimination does not preserve zeros between
bands, it does not introduce nonzero entries outside the limits defined by the original
bands. Hence a band structure is advantageous. In (13) it has been achieved by carefully
ordering the mesh points.
ADI Method
A matrix is called a tridiagonal matrix if it has all its nonzero entries on the main
diagonal and on the two sloping parallels immediately above or below the diagonal. (See
also Sec. 20.9.) In this case the Gauss elimination is particularly simple.
This raises the question of whether, in the solution of the Dirichlet problem for the
Laplace or Poisson equations, one could obtain a system of equations whose coefficient
matrix is tridiagonal. The answer is yes, and a popular method of that kind, called the
ADI method (alternating direction implicit method) was developed by Peaceman and
Rachford. The idea is as follows. The stencil in (9) shows that we could obtain a tridiagonal
matrix if there were only the three points in a row (or only the three points in a column).
This suggests that we write (11) in the form
(14a) u (cid:2)4u (cid:4)u (cid:3)(cid:2)u (cid:2)u
i(cid:2)1,j ij i(cid:4)1,j i,j(cid:2)1 i,j(cid:4)1
so that the left side belongs to y-Row j only and the right side to x-Column i. Of course,
we can also write (11) in the form
(14b) u (cid:2)4u (cid:4)u (cid:3)(cid:2)u (cid:2)u
i,j(cid:2)1 ij i,j(cid:4)1 i(cid:2)1,j i(cid:4)1,j
so that the left side belongs to Column i and the right side to Row j. In the ADI method
we proceed by iteration. At every mesh point we choose an arbitrary starting value u(0).
ij
In each step we compute new values at all mesh points. In one step we use an iteration
formula resulting from (14a) and in the next step an iteration formula resulting from (14b),
and so on in alternating order.
In detail: suppose approximations u(m) have been computed. Then, to obtain the next
ij
approximations u(m(cid:4)1),we substitute the u(m)on the rightside of (14a) and solve for the
ij ij
u(m(cid:4)1)
on the left side; that is, we use
ij
(15a) u(m(cid:4)1) (cid:2)4u(m(cid:4)1) (cid:4)u(m(cid:4)1) (cid:3)(cid:2)u(m) (cid:2)u(m) .
i(cid:2)1,j ij i(cid:4)1,j i,j(cid:2)1 i,j(cid:4)1
We use (15a) for a fixed j, that is, for a fixed row j, and for all internal mesh points in
this row. This gives a linear system of N algebraic equations (N(cid:3)number of internal
mesh points per row) in Nunknowns, the new approximations of uat these mesh points.
Note that (15a) involves not only approximations computed in the previous step but also
given boundary values. We solve the system (15a) (jfixed!) by Gauss elimination. Then
we go to the next row, obtain another system of N equations and solve it by Gauss, and
so on, until all rows are done. In the next step we alternate direction, that is, we compute
c21-b.qxd 11/3/10 2:53 PM Page 929

the next approximations
u(m(cid:4)2)column
by column from the
u(m(cid:4)1)and
the given boundary

values, using a formula obtained from (14b) by substituting the
u(m(cid:4)1)
on the right:

i,j(cid:2)1 ij i,j(cid:4)1 i(cid:2)1,j i(cid:4)1,j
For each fixed i, that is, for each column,this is a system of Mequations (M (cid:3)number
of internal mesh points per column) in Munknowns, which we solve by Gauss elimination.
Then we go to the next column, and so on, until all columns are done.
Let us consider an example that merely serves to explain the entire method.
EXAMPLE 2 Dirichlet Problem. ADI Method
Explain the procedure and formulas of the ADI method in terms of the problem in Example 1, using the same
grid and starting values 100, 100, 100, 100.
Solution. While working, we keep an eye on Fig. 455b and the given boundary values. We obtain first
approximations u(1), u(1), u(1), u(1)from (15a) with m(cid:3)0.We write boundary values contained in (15a) without
11 21 12 22
an upper index, for better identification and to indicate that these given values remain the same during the
iteration. From (15a) with m(cid:3)0we have for j(cid:3)1(first row) the system
(i(cid:3)1) u (cid:2)4u(1)(cid:4) u(1) (cid:3)(cid:2)u (cid:2)u(0)

The solution is u(1)(cid:3)u(1)(cid:3)100.For j(cid:3)2(second row) we obtain from (15a) the system

The solution is u(1)(cid:3)u(1)(cid:3)66.667.
12 22
Second approximations u(2), u(2), u(2), u(2) are now obtained from (15b) with m(cid:3)1 by using the first
11 21 12 22
approximations just computed and the boundary values. For i(cid:3)1(first column) we obtain from (15b) the system
(j(cid:3)1) u (cid:2)4u(2)(cid:4) u(2) (cid:3)(cid:2)u (cid:2)u(1)

In this example, which merely serves to explain the practical procedure in the ADI method, the accuracy of
the second approximations is about the same as that of two Gauss–Seidel steps in Sec. 20.3 (where

write (11) in the form

For p(cid:3)2,this is (15). The parameter pmay be used for improving convergence. Indeed,
one can show that the ADI method converges for positive p, and that the optimum value
for maximum rate of convergence is

by letting p vary from step to step. More details of the ADI method and variants are

Neumann and Mixed Problems.
Irregular Boundary
We continue our discussion of boundary value problems for elliptic PDEs in a region R
in the xy-plane. The Dirichlet problem was studied in the last section. In solving Neumann
and mixed problems(defined in the last section) we are confronted with a new situation,
because there are boundary points at which the (outer) normal derivativeu (cid:3) 0u 0nof

the solution is given, but u itself is unknown since it is not given. To handle such points
we need a new idea. This idea is the same for Neumann and mixed problems. Hence we
may explain it in connection with one of these two types of problems. We shall do so and
consider a typical example as follows.

P and P are internal mesh points and can be handled as in the last section. Indeed, from (7), Sec. 21.4, with
11 21
h2(cid:3)0.25and h2f(x, y)(cid:3)3xyand from the given boundary values we obtain two equations corresponding to
P and P ,as follows (with (cid:2)0resulting from the left boundary).

The only difficulty with these equations seems to be that they involve the unknown values u and u of uat
12 22
P and P on the boundary, where the normal derivative u (cid:3)0u 0n(cid:3)0u 0yis given, instead of u; but we
12 22 n > >
shall overcome this difficulty as follows.
We consider P and P .The idea that will help us here is this. We imagine the region Rto be extended
12 22
above to the first row of external mesh points (corresponding to y(cid:3)1.5), and we assume that the Poisson
equation also holds in the extended region. Then we can write down two more equations as before (Fig. 458b)

On the right, 1.5 is 12xyh2at (0.5, 1)and 3 is 12xyh2at (1, 1)and 0 (at P )and 3 (at P ) are given boundary
02 32
values. We remember that we have not yet used the boundary condition on the upper part of the boundary of
R, and we also notice that in (2b) we have introduced two more unknowns u , u .But we can now use that
13 23
condition and get rid of u , u by applying the central difference formula for du dy.From (1) we then obtain

Irregular Boundary
We continue our discussion of boundary value problems for elliptic PDEs in a region R
in the xy-plane. If R has a simple geometric shape, we can usually arrange for certain
mesh points to lie on the boundary Cof R, and then we can approximate partial derivatives
as explained in the last section. However, if C intersects the grid at points that are not
mesh points, then at points close to the boundary we must proceed differently, as follows.
The mesh point Oin Fig. 459 is of that kind. For Oand its neighbors Aand Pwe obtain

Methods for Parabolic PDEs
The last two sections concerned elliptic PDEs, and we now turn to parabolic PDEs. Recall
that the definitions of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs were given in Sec. 21.4.
There it was also mentioned that the general behavior of solutions differs from type to
type, and so do the problems of practical interest. This reflects on numerics as follows.
For all three types, one replaces the PDE by a corresponding difference equation, but
for parabolicand hyperbolicPDEs this does not automatically guarantee the convergence
of the approximate solution to the exact solution as the mesh h:0; in fact, it does not
even guarantee convergence at all. For these two types of PDEs one needs additional
conditions (inequalities) to assure convergence and stability, the latter meaning that small
perturbations in the initial data (or small errors at any time) cause only small changes at
later times.
In this section we explain the numeric solution of the prototype of parabolic PDEs, the
one-dimensional heat equation
u (cid:3)c2u (c constant).

This PDE is usually considered for x in some fixed interval, say, 0(cid:9)x(cid:9)L, and time
t(cid:10)0, and one prescribes the initial temperature u(x, 0) (cid:3)f(x) (f given) and boundary
conditions at x(cid:3)0and x(cid:3)Lfor all t(cid:10)0,for instance, u(0, t) (cid:3)0, u(L, t)(cid:3)0.We may
assume c(cid:3)1 and L(cid:3)1; this can always be accomplished by a linear transformation of
x and t (Prob. 1). Then the heat equation and those conditions are
(1) u (cid:3)u 0(cid:9)x(cid:9)1, t(cid:10)0

(2) u(x, 0) (cid:3)f(x) (Initial condition)
(3) u(0, t) (cid:3)u(1, t) (cid:3)0 (Boundary conditions).

of the time step]

Figure 465 shows a corresponding grid and mesh points. The mesh size is hin the x-direction
and kin the t-direction. Formula (4) involves the four points shown in Fig. 466. On the left
in (4) we have used a forwarddifference quotient since we have no information for negative
tat the start. From (4) we calculate u ,which corresponds to time row j(cid:4)1,in terms

That is, u should have a positive coefficient in (5) or (for r(cid:3)1) be absent from (5).

Intuitively, (6) means that we should not move too fast in the t-direction. An example is
given below.
Crank–Nicolson Method
Condition (6) is a handicap in practice. Indeed, to attain sufficient accuracy, we have
to choose h small, which makes k very small by (6). For example, if h(cid:3)0.1, then
k(cid:9)0.005. Accordingly, we should look for a more satisfactory discretization of the
heat equation.
A method that imposes no restriction on r(cid:3)k h2 is the Crank–Nicolson (CN)
>
method,5 which uses values of u at the six points in Fig. 467. The idea of the method
is the replacement of the difference quotient on the right side of (4) by 1 times the
2
sum of two such difference quotients at two time rows (see Fig. 467). Instead of (4)
we then have

Multiplying by 2k and writing r(cid:3)k h2 as before, we collect the terms corresponding to
>
time row j(cid:4)1 on the left and the terms corresponding to time row j on the right:
(8) (2 (cid:4)2r)u (cid:2)r(u (cid:4)u (cid:3)(2 (cid:2)2r)u (cid:4)r(u (cid:4)u ).
i, j(cid:4)1 i(cid:4)1, j(cid:4)1 i(cid:2)1, j(cid:4)1 ij i(cid:4)1, j i(cid:2)1, j
How do we use (8)? In general, the three values on the left are unknown, whereas the
three values on the right are known. If we divide the x-interval 0(cid:9)x(cid:9)1 in (1) into n
equal intervals, we have n(cid:2)1 internal mesh points per time row (see Fig. 465, where
n(cid:3)4).Then for j(cid:3)0and i(cid:3)1,Á , n(cid:2)1,formula (8) gives a linear system of n(cid:2)1
equations for the n(cid:2)1unknown values u , u ,Á , u in the first time row in terms
11 21 n(cid:2)1,1
of the initial values u , u ,Á , u and the boundary values u ((cid:3)0), u ((cid:3)0).

Similarly for j(cid:3)1, j (cid:3)2, and so on; that is, for each time row we have to solve such a
linear system of n(cid:2)1 equations resulting from (8).

EXAMPLE 1 Temperature in a Metal Bar. Crank–Nicolson Method, Explicit Method
Consider a laterally insulated metal bar of length 1 and such that c2(cid:3)1in the heat equation. Suppose that the
ends of the bar are kept at temperature u(cid:3)0°Cand the temperature in the bar at some instant—call it t(cid:3)0—
is f(x)(cid:3)sin px.Applying the Crank–Nicolson method with h(cid:3)0.2and r(cid:3)1,find the temperature u(x, t)in
the bar for 0(cid:9)t(cid:9)0.2.Compare the results with the exact solution. Also apply (5) with an rsatisfying (6),
say, r(cid:3)0.25,and with values not satisfying (6), say, r(cid:3)1and r(cid:3)2.5.
Solution by Crank–Nicolson. Since r(cid:3)1, formula (8) takes the form (9). Since h(cid:3)0.2 and
r(cid:3)k h2(cid:3)1,we have k(cid:3)h2(cid:3)0.04.Hence we have to do 5 steps. Figure 468 shows the grid. We shall need

468 there are 4 internal mesh points. Hence in each time step we would have to solve 4 equations in 4
unknowns. But since the initial temperature distribution is symmetric with respect to x(cid:3)0.5,and u(cid:3)0at
both ends for all t, we have u (cid:3)u , u (cid:3)u in the first time row and similarly for the other rows. This
31 21 41 11
reduces each system to 2 equations in 2 unknowns. By (9), since u (cid:3)u and u (cid:3)0, for j(cid:3)0 these
31 21 01
equations are

Solution by the explicit method (5) with r(cid:4)0.25. For h(cid:3)0.2and r(cid:3)k h2(cid:3)0.25we have

k(cid:3)rh2(cid:3)0.25(cid:3)0.04(cid:3)0.01.Hence we have to perform 4 times as many steps as with the Crank–Nicolson

We can again make use of the symmetry. For j(cid:3)0 we need u (cid:3)0, u (cid:3)0.587785 (see p. 939),

and so on. We have to perform 20 steps instead of the 5 CN steps, but the numeric values show that the accuracy
is only about the same as that of the Crank–Nicolson values CN. The exact 3D-values follow from (10).

Method for Hyperbolic PDEs
In this section we consider the numeric solution of problems involving hyperbolic PDEs.
We explain a standard method in terms of a typical setting for the prototype of a hyperbolic
PDE, the wave equation:
(1) u (cid:3)u 0(cid:9)x(cid:9)1, t(cid:10)0
tt xx
(2) u(x, 0) (cid:3)f(x) (Given initial displacement)
(3) u (x, 0) (cid:3)g(x) (Given initial velocity)
t
(4) u(0, t) (cid:3)u(1, t) (cid:3)0 (Boundary conditions).
Note that an equation u (cid:3)c2u and another x-interval can be reduced to the form (1)
tt xx
by a linear transformation of x and t. This is similar to Sec. 21.6, Prob. 1.
For instance, (1)–(4) is the model of a vibrating elastic string with fixed ends at x(cid:3)0
and x(cid:3)1(see Sec. 12.2). Although an analytic solution of the problem is given in (13),
Sec. 12.4, we use the problem for explaining basic ideas of the numeric approach that are
also relevant for more complicated hyperbolic PDEs.
Replacing the derivatives by difference quotients as before, we obtain from (1) [see (6)
in Sec. 21.4 with y(cid:3)t]

It can be shown that for 0(cid:6)r*(cid:9)1 the present explicit method is stable, so that from
(6) we may expect reasonable results for initial data that have no discontinuities. (For a
hyperbolic PDE the latter would propagate into the solution domain—a phenomenon that
would be difficult to deal with on our present grid. For unconditionally stable implicit
methods see [E1] in App. 1.)

parabolic case involved only 2 time steps. Furthermore, we now have 2 initial conditions.
So we ask how we get started and how we can use the initial condition (3). This can be
done as follows.

This is the end of Chap. 21 on numerics for ODEs and PDEs, a field that continues to
develop rapidly in both applications and theoretical research. Much of the activity in the
field is due to the computer serving as an invaluable tool for solving large-scale and
complicated practical problems as well as for testing and experimenting with innovative
ideas. These ideas could be small or major improvements on existing numeric algorithms
or testing new algorithms as well as other ideas.

Taking one more term into account, we obtain the improved Euler method. Both
methods show the basic idea but are too inaccurate in most cases.
Truncating after the term in h4, we get the important classical Runge–Kutta
(RK) methodof fourth order. The crucial idea in this method is the replacement
of the cumbersome evaluation of derivatives by the evaluation of f(x, y) at
suitable points (x, y);thus in each step we first compute four auxiliary quantities

Error and step size control are possible by step halving or by RKF

The methods in Sec. 21.1 are one-step methods since they get y from the

These PDEs are elliptic, parabolic,and hyperbolic,respectively. Corresponding
numeric methods differ, for the following reason. For elliptic PDEs we have
boundary value problems, and we discussed for them the Gauss–Seidel method
(also known as Liebmann’s method) and the ADI method (Secs. 21.4, 21.5). For
parabolic PDEs we are given one initial condition and boundary conditions, and
we discussed an explicit method and the Crank–Nicolson method (Sec. 21.6). For
hyperbolic PDEs, the problems are similar but we are given a second initial
condition (Sec. 21.7).

CHAPTER 22 Unconstrained Optimization. Linear Programming
CHAPTER 23 Graphs. Combinatorial Optimization
The material of Part F is particularly useful in modeling large-scale real-world problems.
Just as it is in numerics in Part E, where the greater availability of quality software and
computing power is a deciding factor in the continued growth of the field, so it is also in
the fields of optimization and combinatorial optimization. Problems, such as optimizing
production plans for different industries (microchips, pharmaceuticals, cars, aluminum,
steel, chemicals), optimizing usage of transportation systems (usage of runways in airports,
tracks of subways), efficiency in running of power plants, optimal shipping (delivery
services, shipping of containers, shipping goods from factories to warehouses and from
warehouses to stores), designing optimal financial portfolios, and others are all examples
where the size of the problem usually requires the use of optimization software. More
recently, environmental concerns have put new aspects into the picture, where an important
concern, added to these problems, is the minimization of environmental impact. The main
task becomes to model these problems correctly. The purpose of Part F is to introduce
the main ideas and methods of unconstrained and constrained optimization (Chap. 22),
and graphs and combinatorial optimization (Chap. 23).
Chapter 22 introduces unconstrained optimization by the method of steepest descent and
constrained optimization by the versatile simplex method. The simplex method (Secs.
22.3, 22.4) is very useful for solving many linear optimization problems (also called linear
programming problems).
Graphs let us model problems in transportation logistics, efficient use of communication
networks, best assignment of workers to jobs, and others. We consider shortest path problems
(Secs. 22.2, 22.3), shortest spanning trees (Secs. 23.4, 23.5), flow problems in networks (Secs.
23.6, 23.7), and assignment problems (Sec. 23.8). We discuss algorithms of Moore, Dijkstra
(both for shortest path), Kruskal, Prim (shortest spanning trees), and Ford–Fulkerson (for flow).

Unconstrained Optimization.
Linear Programming
Optimization is a general term used to describe types of problems and solution techniques
that are concerned with the best (“optimal”) allocation of limited resources in projects. The
problems are called optimization problems and the methods optimization methods. Typical
problems are concerned with planning and making decisions, such as selecting an optimal
production plan. A company has to decide how many units of each product from a choice
of (distinct) products it should make. The objective of the company may be to maximize
overall profit when the different products have different individual profits. In addition, the
company faces certain limitations (constraints). It may have a certain number of machines,
it takes a certain amount of time and usage of these machines to make a product, it requires
a certain number of workers to handle the machines, and other possible criteria. To solve
such a problem, you assign the first variable to number of units to be produced of the first
product, the second variable to the second product, up to the number of different (distinct)
products the company makes. When you multiply these, for example, by the price, you
obtain a linear function called the objective function. You also express the constraints in
terms of these variables, thereby obtaining several inequalities, called the constraints.
Because the variables in the objective function also occur in the constraints, the objective
function and the constraints are tied mathematically to each other and you have set up a
linear optimization problem, also called a linear programming problem.
The main focus of this chapter is to set up (Sec. 22.2) and solve (Secs. 22.3, 22.4) such
linear programming problems. A famous and versatile method for doing so is the simplex
method. In the simplex method, the objective function and the constraints are set up in
the form of an augmented matrix as in Sec. 7.3, however, the method of solving such
linear constrained optimization problems is a new approach.
The beauty of the simplex method is that it allows us to scale problems up to thousands
or more constraints, thereby modeling real-world situations. We can start with a small
model and gradually add more and more constraints. The most difficult part is modeling
the problem correctly. The actual task of solving large optimization problems is done by
software implementations for the simplex method or perhaps by other optimization methods.
Besides optimal production plans, problems in optimal shipping, optimal location of
warehouses and stores, easing traffic congestion, efficiency in running power plants are
all examples of applications of optimization. More recent applications are in minimizing
environmental damages due to pollutants, carbon dioxide emissions, and other factors.
Indeed, new fields of green logistics and green manufacturing are evolving and naturally
make use of optimization methods.
Prerequisite: a modest working knowledge of linear systems of equations.

22.1
Basic Concepts.
Unconstrained Optimization:
Method of Steepest Descent
In an optimization problem the objective is to optimize (maximize or minimize) some
function f. This function fis called the objective function. It is the focal point or goal of
our optimization problem.
For example, an objective function fto be maximizedmay be the revenue in a production
of TV sets, the rate of return of a financial portfolio, the yield per minute in a chemical
process, the mileage per gallon of a certain type of car, the hourly number of customers
served in a bank, the hardness of steel, or the tensile strength of a rope.
Similarly, we may want to minimize f if f is the cost per unit of producing certain
cameras, the operating cost of some power plant, the daily loss of heat in a heating system,
CO emissions from a fleet of trucks for freight transport, the idling time of some lathe,
2
or the time needed to produce a fender.
In most optimization problems the objective function f depends on several variables
Á
x , , x .
1 n
These are called control variablesbecause we can “control” them, that is, choose their values.
For example, the yield of a chemical process may depend on pressure x and temperature
1
x .The efficiency of a certain air-conditioning system may depend on temperature x ,air
2 1
pressure x , moisture content x , cross-sectional area of outlet x , and so on.

Optimization theory develops methods for optimal choices of x , , x ,which maximize
1 n
Á
(or minimize) the objective function f, that is, methods for finding optimal values of x , , x .
1 n
Á
In many problems the choice of values of x , , x is not entirely free but is subject
1 n
to some constraints,that is, additional restrictions arising from the nature of the problem
and the variables.
For example, if x is production cost, then x (cid:7)0, and there are many other variables
1 1
(time, weight, distance traveled by a salesman, etc.) that can take nonnegative values only.
Constraints can also have the form of equations (instead of inequalities).
Á
We first consider unconstrained optimization in the case of a function f(x , , x ).
1 n
We also write x(cid:3)(x ,Á , x ) and f(x), for convenience.
1 n
By definition, fhas a minimumat a point x(cid:3)X in a region R(where fis defined) if

for all x in R. Similarly, f has a maximum at X in R if
0
f(x) (cid:8)f(X )
0
for all x in R. Minima and maxima together are called extrema.
Furthermore, f is said to have a local minimum at X if
0
f(x) (cid:7)f(X )
0
for all x in a neighborhood of X , say, for all x satisfying

If f is differentiable and has an extremum at a point X in the interior of a region R

(that is, not on the boundary), then the partial derivatives 0f 0x ,Á , 0f 0x must be zero

by grad f or (cid:9)f. (For n(cid:3)3 this agrees with Sec. 9.7.) Thus
(1) (cid:9)f(X )(cid:3)0.
0
A point X at which (1) holds is called a stationary point of f.
0
Condition (1) is necessary for an extremum of f at X in the interior of R, but is not
0
sufficient. Indeed, if n(cid:3)1, then for y(cid:3)f(x), condition (1) is yr (cid:3)fr (X )(cid:3)0; and, for
0
instance, y(cid:3)x3 satisfies yr (cid:3)3x2(cid:3)0 at x(cid:3)X (cid:3)0 where f has no extremum but a
0
point of inflection. Similarly, for f(x) (cid:3)x x we have (cid:9)f(0) (cid:3)0,and fdoes not have an
1 2
extremum but has a saddle point at 0. Hence, after solving (1), one must still find out
whether one has obtained an extremum. In the case n(cid:3)1 the conditions yr (X )(cid:3)0,
0
ys (X )(cid:2)0 guarantee a local minimum at X and the conditions yr (X )(cid:3)0, ys (X )(cid:6)0 a
0 0 0 0
local maximum, as is known from calculus. For n(cid:2)1there exist similar criteria. However,
in practice, even solving (1) will often be difficult. For this reason, one generally prefers
solution by iteration, that is, by a search process that starts at some point and moves
stepwise to points at which f is smaller (if a minimum of f is wanted) or larger (in the
case of a maximum).
The method of steepest descentor gradient methodis of this type. We present it here
in its standard form. (For refinements see Ref. [E25] listed in App. 1.)
The idea of this method is to find a minimum of f(x)by repeatedly computing minima
of a function g(t) of a single variable t, as follows. Suppose that f has a minimum at X
0
and we start at a point x. Then we look for a minimum of fclosest to xalong the straight
line in the direction of (cid:4)(cid:9)f(x), which is the direction of steepest descent ((cid:3) direction
ofmaximum decrease) of fat x. That is, we determine the value of tand the correspond-
ing point
(2) z(t)(cid:3)x(cid:4)t(cid:9)f(x)
at which the function
(3) g(t)(cid:3)f(z(t))
has a minimum. We take this z(t) as our next approximation to X .

Figure 473 suggests that in the case of slimmer ellipses (“a long narrow valley”), convergence would be
poor. You may confirm this by replacing the coefficient 3 in (4) with a large coefficient. For more sophisticated

problems with constraints, that is, methods for finding a maximum (or a minimum)

satisfying the constraints. The latter are linear inequalities, such as 3x (cid:5)4x (cid:8)36, or
1 2
x (cid:7)0, etc. (examples below). Problems of this kind arise frequently, almost daily, for
1
instance, in production, inventory management, bond trading, operation of power plants,
routing delivery vehicles, airplane scheduling, and so on. Progress in computer technology
has made it possible to solve programming problems involving hundreds or thousands or
more variables. Let us explain the setting of a linear programming problem and the idea
of a “geometric” solution, so that we shall see what is going on.
EXAMPLE 1 Production Plan
Energy Savers, Inc., produces heaters of types Sand L.The wholesale price is $40per heater for Sand $88for
L.Two time constraints result from the use of two machines M and M .On M one needs 2 min for an Sheater
1 2 1
and 8 min for an Lheater. On M one needs 5 min for an Sheater and 2 min for an Lheater. Determine production
2
figures x and x for Sand L, respectively (number of heaters produced per hour), so that the hourly revenue
1 2
z(cid:3)f(x)(cid:3)40x (cid:5)88x
1 2
is maximum.
Solution. Production figures x and x must be nonnegative. Hence the objective function (to be maximized)
1 2
and the four constraints are

move the line upward (parallel to itself), as the arrow shows. Equation (1) with the equality sign is marked (1).
It intersects the coordinate axes at x (cid:3)60 2(cid:3)30(set x (cid:3)0)and x (cid:3)60 8(cid:3)7.5(set x (cid:3)0).The arrow
1 > 2 2 > 1
marks the side on which the points (x , x )lie that satisfy the inequality in (1). Similarly for Eqs. (2)–(4). The
1 2
blue quadrangle thus obtained is called the feasibility region. It is the set of all feasible solutions, meaning
c22.qxd 11/3/10 4:00 PM Page 955
SEC. 22.2 Linear Programming 955
solutions that satisfy all four constraints. The figure also lists the revenue at O, A, B, C. The optimal solution
is obtained by moving the line of constant revenue up as much as possible without leaving the feasibility region
completely. Obviously, this optimum is reached when that line passes through B, the intersection (10, 5) of (1)
and (2). We see that the optimal revenue

Fig. 474. Linear programming in Example 1
Note well that the problem in Example 1 or similar optimization problems cannot be
solved by setting certain partial derivatives equal to zero, because crucial to such problems
is the region in which the control variables are allowed to vary.
Furthermore, our “geometric” or graphic method illustrated in Example 1 is confined
to two variables x , x . However, most practical problems involve much more than two
1 2
variables, so that we need other methods of solution.
Normal Form of a Linear Programming Problem
To prepare for general solution methods, we show that constraints can be written more
uniformly. Let us explain the idea in terms of (1),
2x (cid:5)8x (cid:8)60.
1 2
This inequality implies 60(cid:4)2x (cid:4)8x (cid:7)0 (and conversely), that is, the quantity
1 2
x (cid:3)60(cid:4)2x (cid:4)8x
3 1 2
is nonnegative. Hence, our original inequality can now be written as an equation
2x (cid:5)8x (cid:5)x (cid:3)60,
1 2 3
where
x (cid:7)0.

c22.qxd 11/3/10 4:00 PM Page 956
956 CHAP. 22 Unconstrained Optimization. Linear Programming
x is a nonnegative auxiliary variable introduced for converting inequalities to equations.
3
Such a variable is called a slack variable, because it “takes up the slack” or difference
between the two sides of the inequality.
EXAMPLE 2 Conversion of Inequalities by the Use of Slack Variables
With the help of two slack variables x , x we can write the linear programming problem in Example 1 in the
3 4
following form. Maximize
f(cid:3)40x (cid:5)88x
1 2
subject to the constraints
2x 1(cid:5)8x 2(cid:5)x

(cid:3)60
5x (cid:5)2x (cid:5)x (cid:3)60
1 2 4
x (cid:7)0 (i(cid:3)1,Á , 4).
i
We now have n(cid:3)4variables and m(cid:3)2(linearly independent) equations, so that two of the four variables,
for example, x , x ,determine the others. Also note that each of the four sides of the quadrangle in Fig. 474
1 2
now has an equation of the form x (cid:3)0:
i
OA:x (cid:3)0,
2
AB:x (cid:3)0,
4
BC:x (cid:3)0,
3
CO:x (cid:3)0,
1
A vertex of the quadrangle is the intersection of two sides. Hence at a vertex, n(cid:4)m(cid:3)4(cid:4)2(cid:3)2 of the
variables are zero and the others are nonnegative. Thus at Awe have x (cid:3)0, x (cid:3)0,and so on. (cid:2)
2 4
Our example suggests that a general linear optimization problem can be brought to the
following normal form. Maximize
(5) f(cid:3)c x (cid:5)c x (cid:5)Á (cid:5)c x

with all b nonnegative. (If a b (cid:6)0,multiply the equation by (cid:4)1.)Here x ,Á , x include
j j 1 n
the slack variables (for which the c’s in f are zero). We assume that the equations in (6)
j
are linearly independent. Then, if we choose values for n(cid:4)mof the variables, the system
uniquely determines the others. Of course, since we must have
x (cid:7)0,Á , x (cid:7)0,
1 n
this choice is not entirely free.
c22.qxd 11/3/10 4:00 PM Page 957
SEC. 22.2 Linear Programming 957
Our problem also includes the minimization of an objective function f since this
corresponds to maximizing (cid:4)f and thus needs no separate consideration.
Á
An n-tuple (x , , x ) that satisfies all the constraints in (6) is called a feasible point
1 n
or feasible solution. A feasible solution is called an optimal solutionif, for it, the objective
function f becomes maximum, compared with the values of f at all feasible solutions.
Finally, by a basic feasible solution we mean a feasible solution for which at least
n(cid:4)m of the variables x ,Á , x are zero. For instance, in Example 2 we have n(cid:3)4,
1 n
m(cid:3)2,and the basic feasible solutions are the four vertices O, A, B, Cin Fig. 474. Here
B is an optimal solution (the only one in this example).
The following theorem is fundamental.
THEOREM 1 Optimal Solution
Some optimal solution of a linear programming problem (5), (6) is also a basic
feasible solution of (5), (6).
For a proof, see Ref. [F5], Chap. 3 (listed in App. 1). A problem can have many optimal
solutions and not all of them may be basicfeasible solutions; but the theorem guarantees
that we can find an optimal solution by searching through the basic feasible solutions
n n
only. This is a great simplification; but since there are (cid:3) different ways
an(cid:4)m b am b
of equating n(cid:4)mof the nvariables to zero, considering all these possibilities, dropping
those which are not feasible and then searching through the rest would still involve very
much work, even when nand mare relatively small. Hence a systematic search is needed.
We shall explain an important method of this type in the next section.

For finding an optimal solution of this problem, we need to consider only the basic feasible
solutions (defined in Sec. 22.2), but there are still so many that we have to follow a
systematic search procedure. In 1948 G. B. Dantzig1published an iterative method, called
the simplex method, for that purpose. In this method, one proceeds stepwise from one
basic feasible solution to another in such a way that the objective function f always
increases its value. Let us explain this method in terms of the example in the last section.
In its original form the problem concerned the maximization of the objective function

Converting the first two inequalities to equations by introducing two slack variables x , x ,

we obtained the normal form of the problem in Example 2. Together with the objective
function (written as an equation z(cid:4)40x (cid:4)88x (cid:3)0) this normal form is

1GEORGE BERNARD DANTZIG (1914–2005), American mathematician, who is one of the pioneers of
linear programming and inventor of the simplex method. According to Dantzig himself (see G. B. Dantzig,
Linear programming: The story of how it began, in J. K. Lenestra et al., History of Mathematical Programming:
A Collection of Personal Reminiscences. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 1991, pp. 19–31), he was particularly fascinated
by Wassilly Leontief’s input–output model (Sec. 8.2) and invented his famous method to solve large-scale
planning (logistics) problems. Besides Leontief, Dantzig credits others for their pioneering work in linear
programming, that is, JOHN VON NEUMANN (1903–1957), Hungarian American mathematician, Institute for
Advanced Studies, Princeton University, who made major contributions to game theory, computer science,
functional analysis, set theory, quantum mechanics, ergodic theory, and other areas, the Nobel laureates LEONID
VITALIYEVICH KANTOROVICH (1912–1986), Russian economist, and TJALLING CHARLES
KOOPMANS (1910–1985), Dutch–American economist, who shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Economics for
their contributions to the theory of optimal allocation of resources. Dantzig was a driving force in establishing
the field of linear programming and became professor of transportation sciences, operations research, and
computer science at Stanford University. For his work see R. W. Cottle (ed.), The Basic George B. Dantzig.

This matrix is called a simplex tableauor simplex table(the initialsimplex table). These
are standard names. The dashed lines and the letters
z, x ,
Á
, b
1
are for ease in further manipulation.
Every simplex table contains two kinds of variables x . By basic variables we mean
j
those whose columns have only one nonzero entry. Thus x , x in (4) are basic variables
3 4
and x , x are nonbasic variables.
1 2
Every simplex table gives a basic feasible solution. It is obtained by setting the nonbasic
variables to zero. Thus (4) gives the basic feasible solution
x (cid:2)0, x (cid:2)0, x (cid:2)60 1(cid:2)60, x (cid:2)60 1(cid:2)60, z(cid:2)0
1 2 3 > 4 >
with x obtained from the second row and x from the third.
3 4
The optimal solution (its location and value) is now obtained stepwise by pivoting,
designed to take us to basic feasible solutions with higher and higher values of zuntil the
maximum of z is reached. Here, the choice of the pivot equation and pivot are quite
different from that in the Gauss elimination. The reason is that x , x , x , x are restricted
1 2 3 4
to nonnegative values.
Step 1. Operation O : Selection of the Column of the Pivot
1
Select as the column of the pivot the first column with a negative entry in Row 1. In (4)
this is Column 2 (because of the (cid:4)40).
Operation O :Selection of the Row of the Pivot. Divide the right sides [60 and 60 in
2
(4)] by the corresponding entries of the column just selected (60 2(cid:2)30, 60 5(cid:2)12).
> >
Take as the pivot equation the equation that gives the smallest quotient. Thus the pivot
is 5 because 60 5 is smallest.
>
OperationO :Elimination by Row Operations. This gives zeros above and below the
3
pivot (as in Gauss–Jordan, Sec. 7.8).
With the notation for row operations as introduced in Sec. 7.3, the calculations in Step 1
give from the simplex table T in (4) the following simplex table (augmented matrix),
0
with the blue letters referring to the previous table.

We see that basic variables are now x , x and nonbasic variables are x , x . Setting the
1 3 2 4
latter to zero, we obtain the basic feasible solution given by T ,
1
x (cid:2)60 5(cid:2)12, x (cid:2)0, x (cid:2)36 1(cid:2)36, x (cid:2)0, z(cid:2)480.
1 > 2 3 > 4
This is A in Fig. 474 (Sec. 22.2). We thus have moved from O: (0, 0) with z(cid:2)0 to
A: (12, 0) with the greater z(cid:2)480. The reason for this increase is our elimination of a
c22.qxd 11/4/10 1:35 PM Page 961
SEC. 22.3 Simplex Method 961
term ((cid:4)40x ) with a negative coefficient. Hence elimination is applied only to negative
1
entriesin Row 1 but to no others. This motivates the selection of the columnof the pivot.
We now motivate the selection of the row of the pivot. Had we taken the second row
of T instead (thus 2 as the pivot), we would have obtained z(cid:2)1200 (verify!), but this
0
line of constant revenue z(cid:2)1200 lies entirely outside the feasibility region in Fig. 474.
This motivates our cautious choice of the entry 5 as our pivot because it gave the smallest
quotient (60 5(cid:2)12).
>
Step 2. The basic feasible solution given by (5) is not yet optimal because of the negative
entry (cid:4)72in Row 1. Accordingly, we perform the operations O to O again, choosing a
1 3
pivot in the column of (cid:4)72.
OperationO .Select Column 3 of T in (5) as the column of the pivot (because (cid:4)72(cid:6)0).
1 1
Operation O . We have 36 7.2(cid:2)5 and 60 2(cid:2)30. Select 7.2 as the pivot (because

Operation O . Elimination by row operations gives

We see that now x , x are basic and x , x nonbasic. Setting the latter to zero, we obtain
1 2 3 4
from T the basic feasible solution
2
x (cid:2)50 5(cid:2)10, x (cid:2)36 7.2(cid:2)5, x (cid:2)0, x (cid:2)0, z(cid:2)840.
1 > 2 > 3 4
This is Bin Fig. 474 (Sec. 22.2). In this step, zhas increased from 480 to 840, due to the
elimination of (cid:4)72 in T . Since T contains no more negative entries in Row 1, we
1 2
conclude that z(cid:2)f(10, 5) (cid:2)40(cid:2)10(cid:3)88(cid:2)5(cid:2)840 is the maximum possible revenue.
It is obtained if we produce twice as many S heaters as L heaters. This is the solution of
our problem by the simplex method of linear programming. (cid:2)
Minimization. If we want to minimize z(cid:2)f(x) (instead of maximize), we take as the
columns of the pivots those whose entry in Row 1 is positive (instead of negative). In
such a Column k we consider only positive entries t and take as pivot a t for which

b t is smallest (as before). For examples, see the problem set.

Simplex Method: Difficulties
In solving a linear optimization problem by the simplex method, we proceed stepwise
from one basic feasible solution to another. By so doing, we increase the value of the
objective function f. We continue this stepwise procedure, until we reach an optimal
solution. This was all explained in Sec. 22.3. However, the method does not always proceed
so smoothly. Occasionally, but rather infrequently in practice, we encounter two kinds of
difficulties. The first one is the degeneracy and the second one concerns difficulties in
starting.
Degeneracy
A degenerate feasible solutionis a feasible solution at which more than the usual number
n(cid:4)m of variables are zero. Here n is the number of variables (slack and others) and m
the number of constraints (not counting the x (cid:7)0conditions). In the last section, n(cid:3)4
j
and m(cid:3)2, and the occurring basic feasible solutions were nondegenerate; n(cid:4)m(cid:3)2
variables were zero in each such solution.
In the case of a degenerate feasible solution we do an extra elimination step in which
a basic variable that is zero for that solution becomes nonbasic (and a nonbasic variable
becomes basic instead). We explain this in a typical case. For more complicated cases
and techniques (rarely needed in practice) see Ref. [F5] in App. 1.

Difficulties in Starting
As a second kind of difficulty, it may sometimes be hard to find a basic feasible solution
to start from. In such a case the idea of an artificial variable (or several such variables)
is helpful. We explain this method in terms of a typical example.

Note that the first slack variable is negative (or zero), which makes x nonnegative within the feasibility region

(and negative outside). From (7) and (8) we obtain the simplex table

x , x are nonbasic, and we would like to take x , x , x as basic variables. By our usual process of equating
1 2 3 4 5
the nonbasic variables to zero we obtain from this table
x (cid:3)0, x (cid:3)0, x (cid:3)1 ((cid:4)1)(cid:3)(cid:4)1, x (cid:3)2 (cid:3)2, x (cid:3)4 (cid:3)4, z(cid:3)0.

x (cid:6)0indicates that (0, 0)lies outside the feasibility region. Since x (cid:6)0,we cannot proceed immediately.

Now, instead of searching for other basic variables, we use the following idea. Solving the second equation in
(8) for x ,we have

We must take care that x (which is not part of the given problem!) will disappear eventually. We shall see

We have reached the end of our discussion on linear programming. We have presented
the simplex method in great detail as this method has many beautiful applications and
works well on most practical problems. Indeed, problems of optimization appear in civil
engineering, chemical engineering, environmental engineering, management science,
logistics, strategic planning, operations management, industrial engineering, finance, and
other areas. Furthermore, the simplex method allows your problem to be scaled up from
a small modeling attempt to a larger modeling attempt, by adding more constraints and

variables, thereby making your model more realistic. The area of optimization is an active
field of development and research and optimization methods, besides the simplex method,
are being explored and experimented with.

Combinatorial Optimization
Many problems in electrical engineering, civil engineering, operations research, industrial
engineering, management, logistics, marketing, and economics can be modeled by graphs
and directed graphs, called digraphs. This is not surprising as they allow us to model
networks, such as roads and cables, where the nodes may be cities or computers. The
task then is to find the shortest path through the network or the best way to connect
computers. Indeed, many researchers who made contributions to combinatorial
optimization and graphs, and whose names lend themselves to fundamental algorithms
in this chapter, such as Fulkerson, Kruskal, Moore, and Prim, all worked at Bell
Laboratories in New Jersey, the major R&D facilities of the huge telephone and
telecommunication company AT&T. As such, they were interested in methods of
optimally building computer networks and telephone networks. The field has progressed
into looking for more and more efficient algorithms for very large problems.
Combinatorial optimization deals with optimization problems that are of a pronounced
discrete or combinatorial nature. Often the problems are very large and so a direct search
may not be possible. Just like in linear programming (Chap. 22), the computer is an
indispensible tool and makes solving large-scale modeling problems possible. Because
the area has a distinct flavor, different from ODEs, linear algebra, and other areas, we
start with the basics and gradually introduce algorithms for shortest path problems (Secs.
22.2, 22.3), shortest spanning trees (Secs. 23.4, 23.5), flow problems in networks (Secs.
23.6, 23.7), and assignment problems (Sec. 23.8).

Graphs and Digraphs
Roughly, a graph consists of points, called vertices, and lines connecting them, called
edges. For example, these may be four cities and five highways connecting them, as in
Fig. 477. Or the points may represent some people, and we connect by an edge those who
do business with each other. Or the vertices may represent computers in a network and
the edge connections between them. Let us now give a formal definition.

DEFINITION Graph
A graph G consists of two finite sets (sets having finitely many elements), a set V
of points, called vertices, and a set E of connecting lines, called edges, such that
each edge connects two vertices, called the endpoints of the edge. We write
G(cid:2)(V, E).
Excluded are isolated vertices (vertices that are not endpoints of any edge), loops
(edges whose endpoints coincide), and multiple edges (edges that have both
endpoints in common). See Fig. 478.
CAUTION! Our three exclusions are practical and widely accepted, but not uniformly.
For instance, some authors permit multiple edges and call graphs without them simple
graphs. (cid:2)
Á Á Á
We denote vertices by letters, u, v, or v , v , or simply by numbers 1, 2, (as
1 2
Á
in Fig. 477). We denote edges by e , e , or by their two endpoints; for instance,
1 2
e (cid:2)(1, 4), e (cid:2)(1, 2) in Fig. 477.
1 2
An edge (v, v)is called incidentwith the vertex v (and conversely); similarly, (v, v)
i j i i j
is incidentwith v.The number of edges incident with a vertex vis called the degreeof v.
j
Two vertices are called adjacentin Gif they are connected by an edge in G(that is, if they
are the two endpoints of some edge in G).
We meet graphs in different fields under different names: as “networks” in electrical
engineering, “structures” in civil engineering, “molecular structures” in chemistry,
“organizational structures” in economics, “sociograms,” “road maps,” “telecommunication
networks,” and so on.
Digraphs (Directed Graphs)
Nets of one-way streets, pipeline networks, sequences of jobs in construction work, flows
of computation in a computer, producer–consumer relations, and many other applications
suggest the idea of a “digraph” ((cid:2) directed graph), in which each edge has a direction
(indicated by an arrow, as in Fig. 479).

DEFINITION Digraph (Directed Graph)
A digraphG(cid:2)(V, E)is a graph in which each edge e(cid:2)(i, j)has a direction from
its “initial point” i to its “terminal point” j.
Two edges connecting the same two points i, j are now permitted, provided they have
opposite directions, that is, they are (i, j)and (j, i).Example.(1, 4) and (4, 1) in Fig. 479.
A subgraph or subdigraph of a given graph or digraph G(cid:2)(V, E), respectively, is a
graph or digraph obtained by deleting some of the edges and vertices of G, retaining the
other edges of G (together with their pairs of endpoints). For instance, e , e (together
1 3
with the vertices 1, 2, 4) form a subgraph in Fig. 477, and e , e , e (together with the
3 4 5
vertices 1, 3, 4) form a subdigraph in Fig. 479.
Computer Representation of Graphs and Digraphs
Drawings of graphs are useful to people in explaining or illustrating specific situations.
Here one should be aware that a graph may be sketched in various ways; see Fig. 480.
For handling graphs and digraphs in computers, one uses matrices or lists as appropriate
data structures, as follows.

The adjacency matrix of a graph is generally much smaller than the so-called incidence
matrix (see Prob. 18) and is preferred over the latter if one decides to store a graph in a
computer in matrix form.

Lists. The vertex incidence list of a graph shows, for each vertex, the incident edges.
The edge incidence list shows for each edge its two endpoints. Similarly for a digraph;
in the vertex list, outgoing edges then get a minus sign, and in the edge list we now have
ordered pairs of vertices.

Sparse graphsare graphs with few edges (far fewer than the maximum possible number
n(n(cid:3)1) 2,where nis the number of vertices). For these graphs, matrices are not efficient.
>
Lists then have the advantage of requiring much less storage and being easier to handle;
they can be ordered, sorted, or manipulated in various other ways directly within the
computer. For instance, in tracing a “walk” (a connected sequence of edges with pairwise
common endpoints), one can easily go back and forth between the two lists just discussed,
instead of scanning a large column of a matrix for a single 1.
Computer science has developed more refined lists, which, in addition to the actual
content, contain “pointers” indicating the preceding item or the next item to be scanned
or both items (in the case of a “walk”: the preceding edge or the subsequent one). For
details, see Refs. [E16] and [F7].
This section was devoted to basic concepts and notations needed throughout this chapter,
in which we shall discuss some of the most important classes of combinatorial optimization
problems. This will at the same time help us to become more and more familiar with
graphs and digraphs.

Shortest Path Problems. Complexity
The rest of this chapter is devoted to the most important classes of problems of
combinatorial optimization that can be represented by graphs and digraphs. We selected
these problems because of their importance in applications, and present their solutions
in algorithmic form. Although basic ideas and algorithms will be explained and
illustrated by small graphs, you should keep in mind that real-life problems may often
involve many thousands or even millions of vertices and edges. Think of computer
networks, telephone networks, electric power grids, worldwide air travel, and companies
that have offices and stores in all larger cities. You can also think of other ideas for
networks related to the Internet, such as electronic commerce (networks of buyers and
sellers of goods over the Internet) and social networks and related websites, such as
Facebook. Hence reliable and efficient systematic methods are an absolute necessity—
solutions by trial and error would no longer work, even if “nearly optimal” solutions
were acceptable.
We begin with shortest path problems, as they arise, for instance, in designing shortest
(or least expensive, or fastest) routes for a traveling salesman, for a cargo ship, etc. Let
us first explain what we mean by a path.
In a graph G(cid:2)(V, E) we can walk from a vertex v along some edges to some other
1
vertex v . Here we can
k
(A) make no restrictions, or
(B) require that each edge of G be traversed at most once, or
(C) require that each vertex be visited at most once.
In case (A) we call this a walk. Thus a walk from v to v is of the form
1 k
Á
(1) (v , v ), (v , v ), , (v , v ),
1 2 2 3 k(cid:2)1 k
where some of these edges or vertices may be the same. In case (B), where each edge
may occur at most once, we call the walk a trail. Finally, in case (C), where each vertex
may occur at most once (and thus each edge automatically occurs at most once), we call
the trail a path.
We admit that a walk, trail, or path may end at the vertex it started from, in which case
we call it closed; then v (cid:2)v in (1).

A closed path is called a cycle. A cycle has at least three edges (because we do not
have double edges; see Sec. 23.1). Figure 481 illustrates all these concepts.

Shortest Path
To define the concept of a shortest path, we assume that G(cid:2)(V, E)is a weighted graph,
that is, each edge (v, v)in Ghas a given weightor lengthl (cid:5)0.Then a shortest path
i j ij
v :v (with fixed v and v )is a path (1) such that the sum of the lengths of its edges

(l (cid:2)length of (v , v ), etc.) is minimum (as small as possible among all paths from
12 1 2
v to v ). Similarly, a longest path v :v is one for which that sum is maximum.
1 k 1 k
Shortest (and longest) path problems are among the most important optimization problems.
Here, “length” l (often also called “cost” or “weight”) can be an actual length measured
ij
in miles or travel time or fuel expenses, but it may also be something entirely different.
For instance, the traveling salesman problem requires the determination of a shortest
Hamiltonian1cyclein a graph, that is, a cycle that contains all the vertices of the graph.
In more detail, the traveling salesman problem in its most basic and intuitive form can
be stated as follows. You have a salesman who has to drive by car to his customers. He
has to drive to n cities. He can start at any city and after completion of the trip he has to
return to that city. Furthermore, he can only visit each city once. All the cities are linked by
roads to each other, so any city can be visited from any other city directly, that is, if he
wants to go from one city to another city, there is only one direct road connecting those two
cities. He has to find the optimal route, that is, the route with the shortest total mileage for
the overall trip. This is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and comes up in
many different versions and applications. The maximum number of possible paths to be
examined in the process of selecting the optimal path for n cities is (n(cid:3)1)! 2, because,
>
after you pick the first city, you have n(cid:3)1choices for the second city, n(cid:3)2choices for
the third city, etc. You get a total of (n(cid:3)1)!(see Sec. 24.4). However, since the mileage
does not depend on the direction of the tour (e.g., for n(cid:2)4(four cities 1, 2, 3, 4), the tour
1–2–3–4–1 has the same mileage as 1–4–3–2–1, etc., so that we counted all the tours twice!),
the final answer is (n(cid:3)1)! 2.Even for a small number of cities, say n(cid:2)15,the maximum
>
number of possible paths is very large. Use your calculator or CAS to see for yourself! This
means that this is a very difficult problem for larger n and typical of problems in
combinatorial optimization, in that you want a discrete solution but where it might become
nearly impossible to explicitly search through all the possibilities and therefore some
heuristics (rules of thumbs, shortcuts) might be used, and a less than optimal answer suffices.

A variation of the traveling salesman problem is the following. By choosing the “most
profitable” route v :v , a salesman may want to maximize Sl ,where l is his expected

commission minus his travel expenses for going from town i to town j.
In an investment problem, imay be the day an investment is made, jthe day it matures,

Shortest Path If All Edges Have Length l 1
Obviously, if all edges have length l, then a shortest path v :v is one that has the
1 k
smallest number of edges among all paths v :v in a given graph G. For this problem
1 k
we discuss a BFS algorithm. BFS stands for Breadth First Search. This means that in
each step the algorithm visits all neighboring (all adjacent) vertices of a vertex reached,
as opposed to a DFS algorithm (Depth First Searchalgorithm), which makes a long trail
(as in a maze). This widely used BFS algorithm is shown in Table 23.1.
We want to find a shortest path in Gfrom a vertex s(start) to a vertex t(terminal). To
guarantee that there is a path from sto t, we make sure that Gdoes not consist of separate
portions. Thus we assume that Gis connected, that is, for any two vertices vand wthere
is a path v:w in G. (Recall that a vertex v is called adjacent to a vertex u if there is
an edge (u, v) in G.)

EXAMPLE 1 Application of Moore’s BFS Algorithm
Find a shortest path s:tin the graph Gshown in Fig. 482.
Solution. Figure 482 shows the labels. The blue edges form a shortest path (length 4). There is another
shortest path s:t.(Can you find it?) Hence in the program we must introduce a rule that makes backtracking
unique because otherwise the computer would not know what to do next if at some step there is a choice (for
instance, in Fig. 482 when it got back to the vertex labeled 2). The following rule seems to be natural.
Backtracking rule. Using the numbering of the vertices from 1 to n(not the labeling!), at each step, if a
vertex labeled i is reached, take as the next vertex that with the smallest number (not label!) among all the
vertices labeled i(cid:3)1. (cid:2)

Complexity of an Algorithm
Complexity of Moore’s algorithm. To find the vertices to be labeled 1, we have to scan
all edges incident with s. Next, when i(cid:2)1,we have to scan all edges incident with vertices
labeled 1, etc. Hence each edge is scanned twice. These are 2moperations (m(cid:2)number of
edges of G).This is a function c(m).Whether it is 2mor 5m(cid:4)3or 12mis not so essential;
it isessential that c(m)is proportional to m(not m2,for example); it is of the “order” m.
We write for any function am(cid:4)bsimply O(m),for any function am2(cid:4)bm(cid:4)dsimply
O(m2), and so on; here, O suggests order. The underlying idea and practical aspect are
as follows.
In judging an algorithm, we are mostly interested in its behavior for very large problems
(large m in the present case), since these are going to determine the limits of the
applicability of the algorithm. Thus, the essential item is the fastest growing term
(am2 in am2(cid:4)bm(cid:4)d,etc.) since it will overwhelm the others when mis large enough.
Also, a constant factor in this term is not very essential; for instance, the difference between
two algorithms of orders, say, 5m2 and 8m2 is generally not very essential and can be
made irrelevant by a modest increase in the speed of computers. However, it does make
a great practical difference whether an algorithm is of order m or m2 or of a still higher
power mp. And the biggest difference occurs between these “polynomial orders” and
“exponential orders,” such as 2m.
For instance, on a computer that does 109 operations per second, a problem of size
m(cid:2)50will take 0.3 sec with an algorithm that requires m5operations, but 13 days with
an algorithm that requires 2m operations. But this is not our only reason for regarding
polynomial orders as good and exponential orders as bad. Another reason is the gain in
using a faster computer. For example, let two algorithms be O(m) and O(m2).Then, since
1000(cid:2)31.62, an increase in speed by a factor 1000 has the effect that per hour we can
do problems 1000 and 31.6 times as big, respectively. But since 1000(cid:2)29.97, with an
algorithm that is O(2m),all we gain is a relatively modest increase of 10 in problem size
because
29.97(cid:3)2m(cid:2)2m(cid:4)9.97.
c23-a.qxd 11/3/10 3:34 PM Page 979
SEC. 23.2 Shortest Path Problems. Complexity 979
The symbol O is quite practical and commonly used whenever the order of growth is
essential, but not the specific form of a function. Thus if a function g(m) is of the form
g(m)(cid:2)kh(m)(cid:4)more slowly growing terms (k(cid:7)0, constant),
we say that g(m) is of the order h(m) and write
g(m)(cid:2)O(h(m)).
For instance,
am(cid:4)b(cid:2)O(m), am2(cid:4)bm(cid:4)d(cid:2)O(m2), 5(cid:3)2m(cid:4)3m2(cid:2)O(2m).
We want an algorithm (cid:2) to be “efficient,” that is, “good” with respect to
(i) Time (number c (m) of computer operations), or
(cid:2)
(ii) Space (storage needed in the internal memory)
or both. Here c suggests “complexity” of (cid:2). Two popular choices for c are
(cid:2) (cid:2)
(Worst case) c (m)(cid:2)longest time (cid:2) takes for a problem of size m,
(cid:2)
(Average case) c (m)(cid:2)average time (cid:2) takes for a problem of size m.
(cid:2)
In problems on graphs, the “size” will often be m (number of edges) or n (number of
vertices). For Moore’s algorithm, c (m) (cid:2)2min both cases. Hence the complexity of
(cid:2)
Moore’s algorithm is of order O(m).
For a “good” algorithm (cid:2), we want that c (m) does not grow too fast. Accordingly,
(cid:2)
we call (cid:2) efficient if c (m)(cid:2)O(mk) for some integer k(cid:6)0; that is, c may contain
(cid:2) (cid:2)
only powers of m (or functions that grow even more slowly, such as ln m), but no
exponential functions. Furthermore, we call (cid:2) polynomially bounded if (cid:2) is efficient
when we choose the “worst case” c (m). These conventional concepts have intuitive
(cid:2)
appeal, as our discussion shows.
Complexity should be investigated for every algorithm, so that one can also compare
different algorithms for the same task. This may often exceed the level in this chapter;
accordingly, we shall confine ourselves to a few occasional comments in this direction.

Bellman’s Principle. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
We continue our discussion of the shortest path problem in a graph G. The last section
concerned the special case that all edges had length 1. But in most applications the edges
(i, j) will have any lengths l (cid:5)0, and we now turn to this general case, which is of
ij
greater practical importance. We write l (cid:2) (cid:8) for any edge (i,j) that does not exist in G
ij
(setting (cid:8) (cid:4)a(cid:2) (cid:8) for any number a, as usual).
We consider the problem of finding shortest paths from a given vertex, denoted by 1
Á
and called the origin, to all other vertices 2, 3, , n of G. We let L denote the length
j
of a shortest path P: 1:j in G.

From Bellman’s principle we can derive basic equations as follows. For fixed j we may
obtain various paths 1:j by taking shortest paths P for various i for which there is in

i
L (cid:4)l (L (cid:2)length of P). We can now take the minimum over i, that is, pick an i for
i ij i i
which L (cid:4)l is smallest. By the Bellman principle, this gives a shortest path 1:j. It

We denote by (cid:3)(cid:4)and (cid:5)(cid:4)the sets of vertices with a permanent label and with a temporary
label, respectively. The algorithm has an initial step in which vertex 1 gets the permanent
label L (cid:2)0and the other vertices get temporary labels, and then the algorithm alternates

between Steps 2 and 3. In Step 2 the idea is to pick k “minimally.” In Step 3 the idea is
that the upper bounds will in general improve (decrease) and must be updated accordingly.

Shortest Spanning Trees: Greedy Algorithm
So far we have discussed shortest path problems. We now turn to a particularly important
kind of graph, called a tree, along with related optimization problems that arise quite
often in practice.
By definition, a tree T is a graph that is connected and has no cycles. “Connected”
was defined in Sec. 23.3; it means that there is a path from any vertex in T to any other
vertex in T. A cycle is a path s:t of at least three edges that is closed (t (cid:4)s); see also
Sec. 23.2. Figure 489a shows an example.
CAUTION! The terminology varies; cycles are sometimes also called circuits.
A spanning tree T in a given connected graph G(cid:4)(V, E) is a tree containing all the
n vertices of G. See Fig. 489b. Such a tree has n(cid:3)1 edges. (Proof?)
A shortest spanning tree T in a connected graph G (whose edges (i, j) have lengths
l (cid:2)0)is a spanning tree for which Sl (sum over all edges of T) is minimum compared
ij ij
to Sl for any other spanning tree in G.

Fig. 489. Example of (a) a cycle, (b) a spanning tree in a graph
Trees are among the most important types of graphs, and they occur in various
applications. Familiar examples are family trees and organization charts. Trees can be
used to exhibit, organize, or analyze electrical networks, producer–consumer and other
business relations, information in database systems, syntactic structure of computer
programs, etc. We mention a few specific applications that need no lengthy additional
explanations.
Á
The set of shortest paths from vertex 1 to the vertices 2, , nin the last section forms
a spanning tree.
Railway lines connecting a number of cities (the vertices) can be set up in the form of
a spanning tree, the “length” of a line (edge) being the construction cost, and one wants
to minimize the total construction cost. Similarly for bus lines, where “length” may be
c23-b.qxd 11/3/10 4:07 PM Page 985
SEC. 23.4 Shortest Spanning Trees: Greedy Algorithm 985
the average annual operating cost. Or for steamship lines (freight lines), where “length”
may be profit and the goal is the maximization of total profit. Or in a network of telephone
lines between some cities, a shortest spanning tree may simply represent a selection of
lines that connect all the cities at minimal cost. In addition to these examples we could
mention others from distribution networks, and so on.
We shall now discuss a simple algorithm for the problem of finding a shortest spanning
tree. This algorithm (Table 23.3) is particularly suitable for sparse graphs (graphs with
very few edges; see Sec. 23.1).

Solution. See Table 23.4. In some of the intermediate stages the edges chosen form a disconnectedgraph
(see Fig. 491); this is typical. We stop after n(cid:3)1(cid:4)5choices since a spanning tree has n(cid:3)1edges. In our
problem the edges chosen are in the upper part of the list. This is typical of problems of any size; in general,
(cid:2)
edges farther down in the list have a smaller chance of being chosen.

The efficiency of Kruskal’s method is greatly increased by double labeling of
vertices.
Double Labeling of Vertices. Each vertex i carries a double label (r, p), where
i i
r (cid:4)Root of the subtree to which i belongs,
i
p (cid:4)Predecessor of i in its subtree,
i
p (cid:4)0 for roots.
i
This simplifies rejecting.
Rejecting. If (i, j) is next in the list to be considered, reject(i, j) ifr (cid:4)r (that is, iand
i j
j are in the same subtree, so that they are already joined by edges and (i, j) would thus
create a cycle). If r (cid:5)r, include (i, j) in T.
i j
If there are several choices for r, choose the smallest. If subtrees merge (become a
i
single tree), retain the smallest root as the root of the new subtree.
For Example 1 the double-label list is shown in Table 23.5. In storing it, at each instant
one may retain only the latest double label. We show all double labels in order to exhibit
the process in all its stages. Labels that remain unchanged are not listed again.
Underscored are the two 1’s that are the common root of vertices 2 and 3, the reason for
rejecting the edge (2, 3). By reading for each vertex the latest label we can read from
this list that 1 is the vertex we have chosen as a root and the tree is as shown in the last
part of Fig. 491.

This is made possible by the predecessor label that each vertex carries. Also, for accepting
or rejecting an edge we have to make only one comparison (the roots of the two endpoints
of the edge).
Ordering is the more expensive part of the algorithm. It is a standard process in
data processing for which various methods have been suggested (see Sorting in Ref.
[E25] listed in App. 1). For a complete list of m edges, an algorithm would be
O(m log m), but since the n(cid:3)1 edges of the tree are most likely to be found earlier,
2
by inspecting the q ((cid:6) m) topmost edges, for such a list of q edges one would have
O(q log m).

Shortest Spanning Trees:
Prim’s Algorithm
Prim’s6 algorithm, shown in Table 23.6, is another popular algorithm for the shortest
spanning tree problem (see Sec. 23.4). This algorithm avoids ordering edges and gives a
tree T at each stage, a property that Kruskal’s algorithm in the last section did not have
(look back at Fig. 491 if you did not notice it).
In Prim’s algorithm, starting from any single vertex, which we call 1, we “grow” the
tree T by adding edges to it, one at a time, according to some rule (in Table 23.6) until
T finally becomes a spanning tree, which is shortest.
We denote by Uthe set of vertices of the growing tree Tand by Sthe set of its edges.
Thus, initially U (cid:4){1}and S(cid:4)(cid:7);at the end, U(cid:4)V,the vertex set of the given graph
G(cid:4)(V, E), whose edges (i, j) have length l (cid:2)0, as before.

include its other end jin U(choosing the smallest j if there are several, to make the process
unique). Updating labels in Step 3 (at this stage and at any later stage) concerns each
vertex knot yet in U. Vertex khas label l (cid:4)l from before. If l (cid:6)l ,this means
k i(k),k jk k
that kis closer to the new member jjust included in Uthan kis to its old “closest neighbor”
i(k) in U. Then we update the label of k, replacing l (cid:4)l by l (cid:4)l and setting
k i(k),k k jk
i(k)(cid:4)j.If, however, l (cid:8)l (the oldlabel of k), we don’t touch the old label. Thus the
jk k
label l always identifies the closest neighbor of k in U, and this is updated in Step 3 as
k
Uand the tree Tgrow. From the final labels we can backtrack the final tree, and from their
numeric values we compute the total length (sum of the lengths of the edges) of this tree.

and transportation networks.

to it a capacity c (cid:2)0 [(cid:4)maximum possible flow along (i, j)], and at one vertex, s,
ij
called the source, a flow is produced that flows along the edges of the digraph Gto another
vertex, t, called the target or sink, where the flow disappears.
In applications, this may be the flow of electricity in wires, of water in pipes, of cars
on roads, of people in a public transportation system, of goods from a producer to
consumers, of e-mail from senders to recipients over the Internet, and so on.
We denote the flow along a (directed!) edge (i, j) by f and impose two conditions:
ij
1. For each edge (i, j) in G the flow does not exceed the capacity c ,

Paths
By a path v :v from a vertex v to a vertex v in a digraph G we mean a sequence

of edges

(v , v ), (v , v ), , (v , v ),
1 2 2 3 k(cid:2)1 k
regardless of their directions in G, that forms a path as in a graph (see Sec. 23.2). Hence
when we travel along this path from v to v we may traverse some edge in its given
1 k
direction—then we call it a forward edgeof our path—or opposite toits given direction—
then we call it a backward edgeof our path. In other words, our path consists of one-way
streets, and forward edges (backward edges) are those that we travel in the right direction
(in the wrong direction). Figure 494 shows a forward edge (u, v) and a backward edge (w, v)
of a path v :v .
1 k
CAUTION! Each edge in a network has a given direction, which we cannot change.
Accordingly, if (u, v) is a forward edge in a path v :v , then (u, v) can become a
1 k
backward edge only in another path x :x in which it is an edge and is traversed in the
1 j
opposite direction as one goes from x to x ; see Fig. 495. Keep this in mind, to avoid

misunderstandings.

Flow Augmenting Paths
Our goalwill be to maximize the flowfrom the source sto the target tof a given network.
We shall do this by developing methods for increasing an existing flow (including the
special case in which the latter is zero). The idea then is to find a path P: s:t all of
c23-b.qxd 11/3/10 4:07 PM Page 993
SEC. 23.6 Flows in Networks 993
whose edges are not fully used, so that we can push additional flow through P. This
suggests the following concept.
DEFINITION Flow Augmenting Path
A flow augmenting path in a network with a given flow f on each edge (i, j) is a
ij
path P: s:t such that
(i) no forward edge is used to capacity; thus f (cid:6)c for these;
ij ij
(ii) no backward edge has flow 0; thus f (cid:2)0 for these.

Solution. In practical problems, networks are large and one needs a systematic method for augmenting
flows, which we discuss in the next section.In our small network, which should help to illustrate and clarify
the concepts and ideas, we can find flow augmenting paths by inspection and augment the existing flow f(cid:4)9
in Fig. 496. (The outflow from sis 5(cid:13)4(cid:4)9,which equals the inflow 6(cid:13)3into t.)
We use the notation
¢ (cid:4)c (cid:3)f for forward edges
ij ij ij
¢ (cid:4)f for backward edges
ij ij
¢(cid:4)min ¢ taken over all edges of a path.
ij
From Fig. 496 we see that a flow augmenting path P: s:t is P: 1(cid:3)2(cid:3)3(cid:3)6 (Fig. 497), with
1 1
¢ (cid:4)20(cid:3)5(cid:4)15,etc., and ¢(cid:4)3.Hence we can use P to increase the given flow 9 to f(cid:4)9(cid:13)3(cid:4)12.
12 1
All three edges of P are forward edges. We augment the flow by 3. Then the flow in each of the edges of P
1 1
is increased by 3, so that we now have f (cid:4)8(instead of 5), f (cid:4)11(instead of 8), and f (cid:4)9(instead of
12 23 36
6). Edge (2, 3) is now used to capacity. The flow in the other edges remains as before.
We shall now try to increase the flow in this network in Fig. 496 beyond f(cid:4)12.
There is another flow augmenting path P: s:t,namely, P: 1(cid:3)4(cid:3)5(cid:3)3(cid:3)6(Fig. 497). It shows how
2 2
a backward edge comes in and how it is handled. Edge (3, 5) is a backward edge. It has flow 2, so that ¢ (cid:4)2.
36
We compute ¢ (cid:4)10(cid:3)4(cid:4)6,etc. (Fig. 497) and ¢(cid:4)2.Hence we can use P for another augmentation to
14 2
get f(cid:4)12(cid:13)2(cid:4)14.The new flow is shown in Fig. 498. No further augmentation is possible. We shall confirm
later that f(cid:4)14is maximum. (cid:2)

Cut Sets
A cut setis a set of edges in a network. The underlying idea is simple and natural. If we
want to find out what is flowing from s to t in a network, we may cut the network
somewhere between s and t (Fig. 498 shows an example) and see what is flowing in the
edges hit by the cut, because any flow from s to t must sometimes pass through some of
these edges. These form what is called a cut set. [In Fig. 498, the cut set consists of the
edges (2, 3), (5, 2), (4, 5).] We denote this cut set by (S, T). Here Sis the set of vertices
on that side of the cut on which s lies (S(cid:4){s, 2, 4} for the cut in Fig. 498) and T is the
set of the other vertices (T(cid:4){3, 5, t}in Fig. 498). We say that a cut partitionsthe vertex
set V into two parts S and T. Obviously, the corresponding cut set (S, T) consists of all
the edges in the network with one end in S and the other end in T.

Fig. 498. Maximum flow in Example 1
By definition, the capacitycap (S, T) of a cut set (S, T) is the sum of the capacities of
all forward edgesin (S, T) (forward edges only!), that is, the edges that are directed from
S to T,
(3) cap (S, T)(cid:4) Sc [sum over the forward edges of (S, T)].
ij
Thus, cap (S, T)(cid:4)11(cid:13)7(cid:4)18 in Fig. 498.
Explanation. This can be seen as follows. Look at Fig. 498. Recall that for each edge
in that figure, the first number denotes capacity and the second number flow. Intuitively,
you can think of the edges as roads, where the capacity of the road is how many cars can
actually be on the road, and the flow denotes how many cars actually are on the road. To
compute capacity cap (S, T) we are only looking at the first number on the edges. Take
a look and see that the cut physically cuts three edges, that is, (2, 3), (4, 5), and (5, 2).
The cut concerns only forward edges that are being cut, so it concerns edges (2, 3) and
(4, 5) (and does not include edge (5, 2) which is also being cut, but since it goes backwards,
it does not count). Hence (2, 3) contributes 11 and (4, 5) contributes 7 to the capacity cap
(S, T), for a total of 18 in Fig. 498. Hence cap (S, T)(cid:4)18.
The other edges (directed from T to S) are called backward edgesof the cut set (S, T),
and by the net flowthrough a cut set we mean the sum of the flows in the forward edges
minus the sum of the flows in the backward edges of the cut set.
CAUTION! Distinguish well between forward and backward edges in a cut set and in
a path: (5, 2) in Fig. 498 is a backward edge for the cut shown but a forward edge in the
path 1(cid:3)4(cid:3)5(cid:3)2(cid:3)3(cid:3)6.
For the cut in Fig. 498 the net flow is 11(cid:13)6(cid:3)3(cid:4)14.For the same cut in Fig. 496
(not indicated there), the net flow is 8(cid:13)4(cid:3)3(cid:4)9. In both cases it equals the flow f.
SEC. 23.6 Flows in Networks 995
We claim that this is not just by chance, but cuts do serve the purpose for which we have
introduced them:
THEOREM 1 Net Flow in Cut Sets
Any given flow in a network G is the net flow through any cut set (S, T) of G.
PROOF By Kirchhoff’s law (2), multiplied by (cid:3)1, at a vertex i we have
0 if i (cid:5)s, t,
(4) a f ij(cid:3) a f li(cid:4)
f if i (cid:4)s.
j l
Outflow Inflow
Here we can sum over j and l from 1 to n ((cid:4)b number of vertices) by putting f (cid:4)0 for
ij
j(cid:4)i and also for edges without flow or nonexisting edges; hence we can write the two
sums as one,
0 if i(cid:5)s, t,
a ( f ij(cid:3)f ji)(cid:4)
f if i (cid:4)s.
j
We now sum over all i in S. Since s is in S, this sum equals f:
b
(5) a a ( f ij(cid:3)f ji)(cid:4)f.
i(cid:4)Sj(cid:4)V
We claim that in this sum, only the edges belonging to the cut set contribute. Indeed,
edges with both ends in T cannot contribute, since we sum only over i in S; but edges
(i,j) with both ends in Scontribute (cid:13)f at one end and (cid:3)f at the other, a total contribution
ij ij
of 0. Hence the left side of (5) equals the net flow through the cut set. By (5), this is equal
to the flow f and proves the theorem. (cid:2)
This theorem has the following consequence, which we shall also need later in this
section.
THEOREM 2 Upper Bound for Flows
A flow f in a network G cannot exceed the capacity of any cut set (S, T) in G.
PROOF By Theorem 1 the flow f equals the net flow through the cut set, f(cid:4)f (cid:3)f , where f
1 2 1
is the sum of the flows through the forward edges and f ((cid:8) 0) is the sum of the flows
2
through the backward edges of the cut set. Thus f(cid:12)f . Now f cannot exceed the sum
1 1
of the capacities of the forward edges; but this sum equals the capacity of the cut set, by
definition. Together, f(cid:12)cap (S, T), as asserted. (cid:2)

Cut sets will now bring out the full importance of augmenting paths:
THEOREM 3 Main Theorem. Augmenting Path Theorem for Flows
A flow from s to t in a network G is maximum if and only if there does not exist a
flow augmenting path s:t in G.
PROOF (a)If there is a flow augmenting path P: s:t,we can use it to push through it an additional
flow. Hence the given flow cannot be maximum.
(b) On the other hand, suppose that there is no flow augmenting path s:t in G.
Let S be the set of all vertices i (including s) such that there is a flow augmenting
0
path s:i,and let T be the set of the other vertices in G. Consider any edge (i, j) with
0
i in S and j in T. Then we have a flow augmenting path s:i since i is in S , but
0 0 0
s:i:j is not flow augmenting because j is not in S . Hence we must have
0
c forward
ij
(6) f (cid:4) if (i, j) is a edge of the path s:i:j.
ij
0 backward
Otherwise we could use (i, j) to get a flow augmenting path s:i:j. Now (S , T)
b b 0 0
defines a cut set (since tis in T;why?). Since by (6), forward edges are used to capacity
0
and backward edges carry no flow, the net flow through the cut set (S , T) equals the
0 0
sum of the capacities of the forward edges, which is cap (S , T) by definition. This
0 0
net flow equals the given flow f by Theorem 1. Thus f(cid:4)cap (S , T). We also have
0 0
f (cid:12)cap (S , T) by Theorem 2. Hence f must be maximum since we have reached
0 0
equality. (cid:2)
The end of this proof yields another basic result (by Ford and Fulkerson, Canadian Journal
of Mathematics 8 (1956), 399–404), namely, the so-called
THEOREM 4 Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem
The maximum flow in any network G equals the capacity of a “minimum cut set”
((cid:4) a cut set of minimum capacity) in G.
PROOF We have just seen that f(cid:4)cap (S , T)for a maximum flow fand a suitable cut set (S , T).
0 0 0 0
Now by Theorem 2 we also have f (cid:12)cap (S, T) for this f and any cut set (S, T) in G.
Together, cap (S , T)(cid:12)cap (S, T). Hence (S , T) is a minimum cut set.
0 0 0 0
The existence of a maximum flow in this theorem follows for rational capacities from
the algorithm in the next section and for arbitrary capacities from the Edmonds–Karp BFS
also in that section. (cid:2)
The two basic tools in connection with networks are flow augmenting paths and cut sets.
In the next section we show how flow augmenting paths can be used in an algorithm for
maximum flows.

Maximum Flow: Ford–Fulkerson Algorithm
Flow augmenting paths, as discussed in the last section, are used as the basic tool in the
Ford–Fulkerson7algorithm in Table 23.8 in which a given flow (for instance, zero flow in
all edges) is increased until it is maximum. The algorithm accomplishes the increase by a
stepwise construction of flow augmenting paths, one at a time, until no further such paths
can be constructed, which happens precisely when the flow is maximum.
In Step 1, an initial flow may be given. In Step 3, a vertex j can be labeled if there is
an edge (i, j) with i labeled and
c (cid:2)f (“forward edge”)
ij ij
or if there is an edge (j, i) with i labeled and
f (cid:2)0 (“backward edge”).
ji
To scana labeled vertex imeans to label every unlabeled vertex jadjacent to ithat can be
labeled. Before scanning a labeled vertex i, scan all the vertices that got labeled before i.
This BFS (Breadth First Search) strategy was suggested by Edmonds and Karp in 1972
(Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery19, 248–64). It has the effect that one
gets shortest possible augmenting paths.

Bipartite Graphs. Assignment Problems
From digraphs we return to graphs and discuss another important class of combinatorial
optimization problems that arises in assignment problems of workers to jobs, jobs to
machines, goods to storage, ships to piers, classes to classrooms, exams to time periods,
and so on. To explain the problem, we need the following concepts.
A bipartite graph G(cid:4)(V, E) is a graph in which the vertex set V is partitioned into
two sets S and T (without common elements, by the definition of a partition) such that
every edge of G has one end in S and the other in T. Hence there are no edges in G that
have both ends in S or both ends in T. Such a graph G(cid:4)(V, E) is also written
G(cid:4)(S, T; E).
Figure 503 shows an illustration. V consists of seven elements, three workers a, b, c,
making up the set S, and four jobs 1, 2, 3, 4, making up the set T. The edges indicate that
worker a can do the jobs 1 and 2, worker b the jobs 1, 2, 3, and worker c the job 4. The
problem is to assign one job to each worker so that every worker gets one job to do. This
suggests the next concept, as follows.
DEFINITION Maximum Cardinality Matching
A matching in G(cid:4)(S, T; E) is a set M of edges of G such that no two of them
have a vertex in common. If M consists of the greatest possible number of edges,
we call it a maximum cardinality matching in G.
For instance, a matching in Fig. 503 is M (cid:4){(a, 2), (b, 1)}. Another is M (cid:4){(a, 1),
1 2
(b, 3), (c, 4)}; obviously, this is of maximum cardinality.

of workers to a set T(cid:4){1, 2, 3, 4} of jobs
A vertex v is exposed (or not covered) by a matching M if v is not an endpoint of an
edge of M. This concept, which always refers to some matching, will be of interest when
we begin to augment given matchings (below). If a matching leaves no vertex exposed,
c23-b.qxd 11/3/10 4:07 PM Page 1002
1002 CHAP. 23 Graphs. Combinatorial Optimization
we call it a complete matching. Obviously, a complete matching can exist only if Sand
T consist of the same number of vertices.
We now want to show how one can stepwise increase the cardinality of a matching M
until it becomes maximum. Central in this task is the concept of an augmenting path.
An alternating path is a path that consists alternately of edges in M and not in M
(Fig. 504A). An augmenting pathis an alternating path both of whose endpoints (aand b
in Fig. 504B) are exposed. By dropping from the matching M the edges that are on an
augmenting path P(two edges in Fig. 504B) and adding to Mthe other edges of P(three
in the figure), we get a new matching, with one more edge than M. This is how we use
an augmenting path in augmenting a given matching by one edge. We assert that this
will always lead, after a number of steps, to a maximum cardinality matching. Indeed,
the basic role of augmenting paths is expressed in the following theorem.
(A) Alternating path
b
a
(B) Augmenting path P
Fig. 504. Alternating and augmenting paths.
Heavy edges are those belonging to a matching M
THEOREM 1 Augmenting Path Theorem for Bipartite Matching
A matching M in a bipartite graph G(cid:4)(S, T; E) is of maximum cardinality if and
only if there does not exist an augmenting path P with respect to M.
PROOF (a)We show that if such a path Pexists, then Mis not of maximum cardinality. Let Phave
q edges belonging to M. Then P has q(cid:13)1 edges not belonging to M. (In Fig. 504B we
have q(cid:4)2.) The endpoints a and b of P are exposed, and all the other vertices on P are
endpoints of edges in M, by the definition of an alternating path. Hence if an edge of Mis
not an edge of P, it cannot have an endpoint on P since then Mwould not be a matching.
Consequently, the edges of Mnot on P, together with the q(cid:13)1edges of Pnot belonging
to Mform a matching of cardinality one more than the cardinality of Mbecause we omitted
qedges from Mand added q(cid:13)1instead. Hence Mcannot be of maximum cardinality.
(b) We now show that if there is no augmenting path for M, then M is of maximum
cardinality. Let M* be a maximum cardinality matching and consider the graph H
consisting of all edges that belong either to Mor to M*,but not to both. Then it is possible
that two edges of H have a vertex in common, but three edges cannot have a vertex in
common since then two of the three would have to belong to M(or to M*),violating that
Mand M*are matchings. So every vin Vcan be in common with two edges of Hor with
one or none. Hence we can characterize each “component” ((cid:4)maximal connectedsubset)
of H as follows.
(A) A component of Hcan be a closed path with an evennumber of edges (in the case
of an oddnumber, two edges from Mor two from M*would meet, violating the matching
property). See (A) in Fig. 505.
c23-b.qxd 11/3/10 4:07 PM Page 1003
SEC. 23.8 Bipartite Graphs. Assignment Problems 1003
(B) A component of Hcan be an open path Pwith the same number of edges from M
and edges from M*, for the following reason. P must be alternating, that is, an edge of
M is followed by an edge of M*, etc. (since M and M* are matchings). Now if P had an
edge more from M*, then P would be augmenting for M [see (B2) in Fig. 505],
contradicting our assumption that there is no augmenting path for M. If P had an edge
more from M, it would be augmenting for M* [see (B3) in Fig. 505], violating the
maximum cardinality of M*,by part (a) of this proof. Hence in each component of H, the
two matchings have the same number of edges. Adding to this the number of edges that
belong to both M and M* (which we left aside when we made up H), we conclude that
M and M* must have the same number of edges. Since M* is of maximum cardinality,
this shows that the same holds for M, as we wanted to prove. (cid:2)

Fig. 505. Proof of the augmenting path theorem for bipartite matching
This theorem suggests the algorithm in Table 23.9 for obtaining augmenting paths, in
which vertices are labeled for the purpose of backtracking paths. Such a label is in
additionto the number of the vertex, which is also retained. Clearly, to get an augmenting
path, one must start from an exposedvertex, and then trace an alternating path until one
arrives at another exposed vertex. After Step 3 all vertices in S are labeled. In Step 4,
the set T contains at least one exposed vertex, since otherwise we would have stopped
at Step 1.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Graphs. Combinatorial Optimization
Combinatorial optimization concerns optimization problems of a discrete or
combinatorial structure. It uses graphs and digraphs (Sec. 23.1) as basic tools.
A graph G(cid:4)(V, E) consists of a set V of vertices v , v ,Á , v (often simply
1 2 n
Á Á
denoted by 1, 2, , n)and a set Eof edgese , e , , e ,each of which connects
1 2 m
two vertices. We also write (i, j) for an edge with vertices i and j as endpoints. A
digraph((cid:4)directed graph) is a graph in which each edge has a direction (indicated
by an arrow). For handling graphs and digraphs in computers, one can use matrices
or lists (Sec. 23.1).
This chapter is devoted to important classes of optimization problems for graphs
and digraphs that all arise from practical applications, and corresponding algorithms,
as follows.
c23-b.qxd 11/3/10 4:07 PM Page 1008
1008 CHAP. 23 Graphs. Combinatorial Optimization
In a shortest path problem(Sec. 23.2) we determine a path of minimum length
(consisting of edges) from a vertex sto a vertex tin a graph whose edges (i, j) have
a “length” l (cid:2)0, which may be an actual length or a travel time or cost or an
ij
electrical resistance [if (i, j) is a wire in a net], and so on. Dijkstra’s algorithm
(Sec.23.3) or, when all l (cid:4)1,Moore’s algorithm(Sec. 23.2) are suitable for these
ij
problems.
A treeis a graph that is connected and has no cycles(no closed paths). Trees are
very important in practice. A spanning treein a graph Gis a tree containing allthe
vertices of G. If the edges of Ghave lengths, we can determine a shortest spanning
tree, for which the sum of the lengths of all its edges is minimum, by Kruskal’s
algorithm or Prim’s algorithm (Secs. 23.4, 23.5).
A network (Sec. 23.6) is a digraph in which each edge (i, j) has a capacity
c (cid:2)0 [(cid:4) maximum possible flow along (i, j)] and at one vertex, the source s, a
ij
flow is produced that flows along the edges to a vertex t, the sink or target, where
the flow disappears. The problem is to maximize the flow, for instance, by applying
the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm (Sec. 23.7), which uses flow augmenting paths
(Sec. 23.6). Another related concept is that of a cut set, as defined in Sec. 23.6.
A bipartite graphG(cid:4)(V, E)(Sec. 23.8) is a graph whose vertex set Vconsists
of two parts Sand Tsuch that every edge of Ghas one end in Sand the other in T,
so that there are no edges connecting vertices in S or vertices in T. A matching in
G is a set of edges, no two of which have an endpoint in common. The problem
then is to find a maximum cardinality matching in G, that is, a matching M that
has a maximum number of edges. For an algorithm, see Sec. 23.8.

CHAPTER 25 Mathematical Statistics
Probability theory (Chap. 24) provides models of probability distributions (theoretical
models of the observable reality involving chance effects) to be tested by statistical methods,
and it will also supply the mathematical foundation of these methods in Chap. 25.
Modern mathematical statistics (Chap. 25) has various engineering applications, for
instance, in testing materials, control of production processes, quality control of production
outputs, performance tests of systems, robotics, and automatization in general, production
planning, marketing analysis, and so on.
To this we could add a long list of fields of applications, for instance, in agriculture,
biology, computer science, demography, economics, geography, management of natural
resources, medicine, meteorology, politics, psychology, sociology, traffic control, urban
planning, etc. Although these applications are very heterogeneous, we shall see that most
statistical methods are universal in the sense that each of them can be applied in various
fields.

Data Analysis.
Probability Theory
We first show how to handle data numerically or in terms of graphs, and how to extract
information (average size, spread of data, etc.) from them. If these data are influenced by
“chance,” by factors whose effect we cannot predict exactly (e.g., weather data, stock
prices, life spans of tires, etc.), we have to rely on probability theory. This theory
originated in games of chance, such as flipping coins, rolling dice, or playing cards.
Nowadays it gives mathematical models of chance processes called random experiments
or, briefly, experiments. In such an experiment we observe a random variable X, that
is, a function whose values in a trial(a performance of an experiment) occur “by chance”
(Sec. 24.3) according to a probability distributionthat gives the individual probabilities
with which possible values of X may occur in the long run. (Example: Each of the six
faces of a die should occur with the same probability, 1 6.) Or we may simultaneously
>
observe more than one random variable, for instance, height and weight of persons or
hardness andtensile strength of steel. This is discussed in Sec. 24.9, which will also give
the basis for the mathematical justification of the statistical methods in Chapter 25.

Data Representation. Average. Spread
Data can be represented numerically or graphically in various ways. For instance, your
daily newspaper may contain tables of stock prices and money exchange rates, curves or
bar charts illustrating economical or political developments, or pie charts showing how
your tax dollar is spent. And there are numerous other representations of data for special
purposes.
In this section we discuss the use of standard representations of data in statistics. (For
these, software packages, such as DATA DESK, R, and MINITAB, are available, and
Maple or Mathematica may also be helpful; see pp. 789 and 1009) We explain corresponding
concepts and methods in terms of typical examples.
EXAMPLE 1 Recording and Sorting
Sample values (observations, measurements) should be recorded in the order in which they occur. Sorting,that
is, ordering the sample values by size, is done as a first step of investigating properties of the sample and graphing
it. Sorting is a standard process on the computer; see Ref. [E35], listed in App. 1.

Graphic Representation of Data
We shall now discuss standard graphic representations used in statistics for obtaining
information on properties of data.
EXAMPLE 2 Stem-and-Leaf Plot (Fig. 507)
This is one of the simplest but most useful representations of data. For (1) it is shown in Fig. 507. The numbers
in (1) range from 78 to 99; see (2). We divide these numbers into 5 groups, 75–79, 80–84, 85–89, 90–94,
95–99. The integers in the tens position of the groups are 7, 8, 8, 9, 9. These form the stemin Fig. 507. The
first leafis 789, representing 77, 78, 79. The second leaf is 1123344, representing 81, 81, 82, 83, 83, 84, 84.
And so on.
The number of times a value occurs is called its absolute frequency. Thus 78 has absolute frequency 1, the
value 89 has absolute frequency 5, etc. The column to the extreme left in Fig. 507 shows the cumulative absolute
frequencies, that is, the sum of the absolute frequencies of the values up to the line of the leaf. Thus, the number
10 in the second line on the left shows that (1) has 10 values up to and including 84. The number 23 in the next
line shows that there are 23 values not exceeding 89, etc. Dividing the cumulative absolute frequencies by
n ((cid:2) 30in Fig. 507) gives the cumulative relative frequencies 0.1, 0.33, 0.76, 0.93, 1.00. (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 3 Histogram (Fig. 508)
For large sets of data, histograms are better in displaying the distribution of data than stem-and-leaf plots. The
principle is explained in Fig. 508. (An application to a larger data set is shown in Sec. 25.7). The bases of the
rectangles in Fig. 508 are the x-intervals (known as class intervals) 74.5–79.5, 79.5–84.5, 84.5–89.5, 89.5–94.5,
94.5–99.5, whose midpoints (known as class marks) are x(cid:2)77, 82, 87, 92, 97,respectively. The height of a
rectangle with class mark xis the relative class frequencyf (x),defined as the number of data values in that
rel
class interval, divided by n ((cid:2) 30 in our case). Hence the areas of the rectangles are proportional to these
relative frequencies, 0.10, 0.23, 0.43, 0.17, 0.07, so that histograms give a good impression of the distribution
(cid:2)
of data.

SEC. 24.1 Data Representation. Average. Spread 1013
EXAMPLE 4 Boxplot. Median. Interquartile Range. Outlier
A boxplot of a set of data illustrates the average size and the spread of the values, in many cases the two most
important quantities characterizing the set, as follows.
The average size is measured by the median, or middle quartile, q .If the number nof values of the set is odd,
M
then q is the middlemost of the values when ordered as in (2). If n is even, then q is the average of thetwo
M M
middlemost values of the ordered set. In (2) we have n(cid:2)30and thus q (cid:2)1(x (cid:4)x )(cid:2)1(87(cid:4)88)(cid:2)87.5.
M 2 15 16 2
(In general, q will be a fraction if nis even.)
M
The spread of values can be measured by the rangeR(cid:2)x (cid:3)x ,the largest value minus the smallest
max min
one.
Better information on the spread gives the interquartile range IQR(cid:2)q (cid:3)q .Here q is the middlemost
U L U
value (or the average of the two middlemost values) in the data abovethe median; and q is the middlemost
L
value (or the average of the two middlemost values) in the data below the median. Hence in (2) we have
q (cid:2)x (cid:2)89, q (cid:2)x (cid:2)83,and IQR(cid:2)89(cid:3)83(cid:2)6.
U 23 L 8
The box in Fig. 509 extends vertically from q to q ;it has height IQR(cid:2)6.The vertical lines below and

above the box extend from x (cid:2)77to x (cid:2)99,so that they show R(cid:2)22.

Data set (1)

The line above the box is suspiciously long. This suggests the concept of an outlier,a value that is more
than 1.5 times the IQR away from either end of the box; here 1.5 is purely conventional. An outlier indicates
that something might have gone wrong in the data collection. In (2) we have 89(cid:4)1.5 IQR(cid:2)98,and we regard
(cid:2)
99 as an outlier.
Mean. Standard Deviation. Variance.
Empirical Rule
Medians and quartiles are easily obtained by ordering and counting, practically without
calculation. But they do not give full information on data: you can change data values to
some extent without changing the median. Similarly for the quartiles.
The average size of the data values can be measured in a more refined way by the
mean

This is the arithmetic mean of the data values, obtained by taking their sum and dividing
by the data size n. Thus in (1),
x (cid:3) 1 (89 (cid:6)77(cid:6) Á (cid:6)89)(cid:3)260 (cid:2)86.7.
30 3
Every data value contributes, and changing one of them will change the mean.
Similarly, the spread (variability) of the data values can be measured in a more refined
way by the standard deviation s or by its square, the variance

[(x 1(cid:2)x)2(cid:6) Á (cid:6)(x n(cid:2)x)2].
j(cid:3)1
Thus, to obtain the variance of the data, take the difference x (cid:2)xof each data value from
j
the mean, square it, take the sum of these nsquares, and divide it by n(cid:2)1(not n, as we
motivate in Sec. 25.2). To get the standard deviation s, take the square root of s2.
For example, using x (cid:3)260 3, we get for the data (1) the variance
>
s2 (cid:3) 1 [(89(cid:2) 260)2(cid:6)(77 (cid:2)260)2(cid:6) Á (cid:6)(89 (cid:2)260)2](cid:3)2006 (cid:2)23.06
29 3 3 3 87
Hence the standard deviation is s(cid:3) 12006 87(cid:2)4.802.Note that the standard deviation

has the same dimension as the data values (kg mm2, see at the beginning), which is an

advantage. On the other hand, the variance is preferable to the standard deviation in
developing statistical methods, as we shall see in Chap. 25.
CAUTION! Your CAS (Maple, for instance) may use 1 n instead of 1 (n(cid:2)1) in (4),
> >
but the latter is better when n is small (see Sec. 25.2).
Mean and standard deviation, introduced to give center and spread, actually give much
more information according to this rule.
Empirical Rule. For any mound-shaped, nearly symmetric distribution of data the intervals
x (cid:5) s, x (cid:5) 2s, x (cid:5) 3s contain about 68%, 95%, 99.7%,
respectively, of the data points.
EXAMPLE 5 Empirical Rule and Outliers. z-Score
For (1), with x(cid:3)86.7 and s(cid:3)4.8, the three intervals in the Rule are 81.9(cid:4)x(cid:4)91.5, 77.1(cid:4)x(cid:4)96.3,
72.3(cid:4)x(cid:4)101.1 and contain 73% (22 values remain, 5 are too small, and 5 too large), 93% (28 values,
1toosmall, and 1 too large), and 100%,respectively.
If we reduce the sample by omitting the outlier 99, mean and standard deviation reduce to x (cid:3)86.2,s (cid:3)4.3,
red red
approximately, and the percentage values become 67%(5 and 5 values outside), 93%(1 and 1 outside), and 100%.
Finally, the relative position of a value xin a set of mean xand standard deviation scan be measured by the
z-score
x(cid:2)x
z(s)(cid:3) .
s
This is the distance of x from the mean x measured in multiples of s. For instance, z(83)(cid:3) (83(cid:2)86.7)
>
4.8(cid:3)(cid:2)0.77.This is negative because 83 lies below the mean. By the Empirical Rule, the extreme z-values
are about (cid:2)3and 3. (cid:2)

Experiments, Outcomes, Events
We now turn to probability theory. This theory has the purpose of providing mathematical
models of situations affected or even governed by “chance effects,” for instance, in weather
forecasting, life insurance, quality of technical products (computers, batteries, steel sheets,
etc.), traffic problems, and, of course, games of chance with cards or dice. And the accuracy
of these models can be tested by suitable observations or experiments—this is a main
purpose of statistics to be explained in Chap. 25.
We begin by defining some standard terms. An experimentis a process of measurement
or observation, in a laboratory, in a factory, on the street, in nature, or wherever; so
“experiment” is used in a rather general sense. Our interest is in experiments that involve
randomness, chance effects, so that we cannot predict a result exactly. A trialis a single
performance of an experiment. Its result is called an outcomeor a sample point. ntrials
then give a sample of size n consisting of n sample points. The sample space S of an
experiment is the set of all possible outcomes.
c24.qxd 11/3/10 5:12 PM Page 1016

EXAMPLES 1–6 Random Experiments. Sample Spaces
(1) Inspecting a lightbulb. S(cid:2){Defective, Nondefective}.
(2) Rolling a die. S(cid:2){1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
(3) Measuring tensile strength of wire. Sthe numbers in some interval.
(4) Measuring copper content of brass. S: 50% to 90%,say.
(5) Counting daily traffic accidents in New York. Sthe integers in some interval.
(6) Asking for opinion about a new car model. S(cid:2){Like, Dislike, Undecided}. (cid:2)
The subsets of S are called events and the outcomes simple events.
EXAMPLE 7 Events
In (2), events are A(cid:2){1, 3, 5} (“Odd number”), B(cid:2){2, 4, 6} (“Even number”), C(cid:2){5, 6}. etc. Simple
Á (cid:2)
events are {1}, {2}, , {6}.
If, in a trial, an outcome a happens and a (cid:4) A (a is an element of A), we say that A
happens. For instance, if a die turns up a 3, the event A: Odd numberhappens. Similarly,
if C in Example 7 happens (meaning 5 or 6 turns up), then, say, D(cid:2){4, 5, 6} happens.
Also note that Shappens in each trial, meaning that someevent of Salways happens. All
this is quite natural.
Unions, Intersections, Complements of Events
In connection with basic probability laws we shall need the following concepts and facts
Á
about events (subsets) A, B, C, of a given sample space S.
The union A(cid:2)B of A and B consists of all points in A or B or both.
The intersection A(cid:3)B of A and B consists of all points that are in both A and B.
If A and B have no points in common, we write
A(cid:3)B(cid:2)(cid:7)
where (cid:7)is the empty set(set with no elements) and we call Aand Bmutually exclusive
(or disjoint) because, in a trial, the occurrence of A excludesthat of B(and conversely)—
if your die turns up an odd number, it cannot turn up an even number in the same trial.
Similarly, a coin cannot turn up Head and Tail at the same time.
Complement Ac of A. This is the set of all the points of S not in A. Thus,
A(cid:3)Ac(cid:2)(cid:7), A(cid:2)Ac(cid:2)S.
In Example 7 we have Ac(cid:2)B, hence A(cid:2)Ac(cid:2){1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}(cid:2)S.
Another notation for the complement of A is A (instead of Ac), but we shall not
use this because in set theory A is used to denote the closure of A (not needed in
our work).
Unions and intersections of more events are defined similarly. The union

Working with events can be illustrated and facilitated by Venn diagrams1for showing
unions, intersections, and complements, as in Figs. 510 and 511, which are typical
examples that give the idea.

Probability
The “probability” of an event Ain an experiment is supposed to measure how frequently
A is about to occur if we make many trials. If we flip a coin, then heads H and tails T
will appear aboutequally often—we say that Hand Tare “equally likely.” Similarly, for
a regularly shaped die of homogeneous material (“fair die”) each of the six outcomes
Á
1, , 6 will be equally likely. These are examples of experiments in which the sample
space S consists of finitely many outcomes (points) that for reasons of some symmetry
can be regarded as equally likely. This suggests the following definition.

that are equally likely, then the probability P(A) of an event A is

From this definition it follows immediately that, in particular,
(2) P(S)(cid:2)1.
EXAMPLE 1 Fair Die
In rolling a fair die once, what is the probability P(A)of Aof obtaining a 5 or a 6? The probability of B: “Even
number”?
Solution. The six outcomes are equally likely, so that each has probability 1 6.Thus P(A)(cid:2)2 6(cid:2)1 3
because A(cid:2){5, 6}has 2 points, and P(B)(cid:2)3 6(cid:2)1 2.

Definition 1 takes care of many games as well as some practical applications, as we shall
see, but certainly not of all experiments, simply because in many problems we do not
have finitely many equally likely outcomes. To arrive at a more general definition of
probability, we regard probability as the counterpart of relative frequency. Recall from
Sec. 24.1 that the absolute frequencyf(A)of an event Ain ntrials is thenumber of times
A occurs, and the relative frequency of A in these trials is f(A) n; thus
>
f(A) Number of times A occurs
(3) f (A)(cid:2) (cid:2) .
rel n Number of trials
Now if Adid not occur, then f(A)(cid:2)0.If Aalways occurred, then f(A)(cid:2)n.These are
the extreme cases. Division by n gives
(4*) 0(cid:5)f (A)(cid:5)1.
rel
In particular, for A(cid:2)S we have f(S) (cid:2)n because S always occurs (meaning that
some event always occurs; if necessary, see Sec. 24.2, after Example 7). Division
by n gives
(5*) f (S)(cid:2)1.
rel
Finally, if Aand Bare mutually exclusive, they cannot occur together. Hence the absolute
frequency of their union A(cid:2)B must equal the sum of the absolute frequencies of A and
B. Division by n gives the same relation for the relative frequencies,
(6*) f (A(cid:2)B)(cid:2)f (A)(cid:4)f (B) (A(cid:3)B(cid:2)(cid:7)).
rel rel rel
We are now ready to extend the definition of probability to experiments in which equally
likely outcomes are not available. Of course, the extended definition should include
Definition 1. Since probabilities are supposed to be the theoretical counterpart of relative
frequencies, we choose the properties in (4*), (5*), (6*) as axioms. (Historically, such a
choice is the result of a long process of gaining experience on what might be best and
most practical.)

DEFINITION 2 General Definition of Probability
Given a sample space S, with each event A of S (subset of S) there is associated a
number P(A), called the probability of A, such that the following axioms of
probability are satisfied.
1. For every A in S,
(4) 0(cid:5)P(A)(cid:5)1.
2. The entire sample space S has the probability
(5) P(S)(cid:2)1.
3. For mutually exclusive events A and B (A(cid:3)B(cid:2)(cid:7); see Sec. 24.2),
(6) P(A(cid:2)B)(cid:2)P(A)(cid:4)P(B) (A(cid:3)B(cid:2)(cid:7)).
If S is infinite (has infinitely many points), Axiom 3 has to be replaced by

In the infinite case the subsets of S on which P(A) is defined are restricted to form a
so-called s-algebra, as explained in Ref. [GenRef6] (not [G6]!) in App. 1. This is of no
practical consequence to us.
Basic Theorems of Probability
We shall see that the axioms of probability will enable us to build up probability theory
and its application to statistics. We begin with three basic theorems. The first of them
is useful if we can get the probability of the complement Ac more easily than P(A)
itself.
THEOREM 1 Complementation Rule
For an event A and its complement Ac in a sample space S,
(7) P(Ac)(cid:2)1(cid:3)P(A).
PROOF By the definition of complement (Sec. 24.2), we have S(cid:2)A(cid:2)Ac and A(cid:3)Ac (cid:2)(cid:7).
Hence by Axioms 2 and 3,
1(cid:2)P(S)(cid:2)P(A)(cid:4)P(Ac), thus P(Ac)(cid:2)1(cid:3)P(A). (cid:2)

EXAMPLE 2 Coin Tossing
Five coins are tossed simultaneously. Find the probability of the event A: At least one head turns up.Assume
that the coins are fair.
Solution. Since each coin can turn up heads or tails, the sample space consists of 25(cid:2)32outcomes. Since
the coins are fair, we may assign the same probability (1 32)to each outcome. Then the event Ac(No heads
turn up) consists of only 1 outcome. Hence P(Ac)(cid:2)1 32> ,and the answer is P(A)(cid:2)1(cid:3)P(Ac)(cid:2)31 32. (cid:2)

The next theorem is a simple extension of Axiom 3, which you can readily prove by
induction.

EXAMPLE 3 Mutually Exclusive Events
If the probability that on any workday a garage will get 10–20, 21–30, 31–40, over 40 cars to service is 0.20,
0.35, 0.25, 0.12, respectively, what is the probability that on a given workday the garage gets at least 21 cars
to service?
Solution. Since these are mutually exclusive events, Theorem 2 gives the answer 0.35(cid:4)0.25(cid:4)0.12(cid:2)0.72.
(cid:2)
Check this by the complementation rule.
In many cases, events will not be mutually exclusive. Then we have
THEOREM 3 Addition Rule for Arbitrary Events
For events A and B in a sample space,
(9) P(A(cid:2)B)(cid:2)P(A)(cid:4)P(B)(cid:3)P(A(cid:3)B).
PROOF C, D, E in Fig. 512 make up A(cid:2)B and are mutually exclusive (disjoint). Hence by
Theorem 2,
P(A(cid:2)B)(cid:2)P(C)(cid:4)P(D)(cid:4)P(E).
This gives (9) because on the right P(C)(cid:4)P(D)(cid:2)P(A) by Axiom 3 and disjointness;
and P(E)(cid:2)P(B) (cid:3)P(D)(cid:2)P(B)(cid:3)P(A(cid:3)B), also by Axiom 3 and disjointness. (cid:2)

Note that for mutually exclusive events A and B we have A(cid:3)B(cid:2)(cid:7) by definition and,
by comparing (9) and (6),
(10) P((cid:7))(cid:2)0.
(Can you also prove this by (5) and (7)?)
EXAMPLE 4 Union of Arbitrary Events
In tossing a fair die, what is the probability of getting an odd number or a number less than 4?
Solution. Let Abe the event “Odd number” and Bthe event “Number less than4.” Then Theorem 3 gives
the answer
P(A(cid:2)B)(cid:2)3(cid:4)3(cid:3)2(cid:2)2
6 6 6 3
because A(cid:3)B(cid:2)“Odd number less than4”(cid:2){1, 3}. (cid:2)
Conditional Probability. Independent Events
Often it is required to find the probability of an event Bunder the condition that an event
Aoccurs. This probability is called the conditional probabilityof B given Aand is denoted
by P(BƒA).In this case Aserves as a new (reduced) sample space, and that probability is
the fraction of P(A) which corresponds to A(cid:3)B. Thus
P(A(cid:3)B)
(11) P(BƒA)(cid:2) [P(A)(cid:8)0].
P(A)
Similarly, the conditional probability of A given B is
P(A(cid:3)B)
(12) P(AƒB)(cid:2) [P(B)(cid:8)0].
P(B)
Solving (11) and (12) for P(A(cid:3)B), we obtain
THEOREM 4 Multiplication Rule
If A and B are events in a sample space S and P(A)(cid:8)0, P(B)(cid:8)0, then
(13) P(A(cid:3)B)(cid:2)P(A)P(BƒA)(cid:2)P(B)P(AƒB).
EXAMPLE 5 Multiplication Rule
In producing screws, let Amean “screw too slim” and B“screw too short.” Let P(A)(cid:2)0.1and let the conditional
probability that a slim screw is also too short be P(BƒA)(cid:2)0.2.What is the probability that a screw that we pick
randomly from the lot produced will be both too slim and too short?
Solution. P(A(cid:3)B)(cid:2)P(A)P(BƒA)(cid:2)0.1 (cid:2) 0.2(cid:2)0.02(cid:2)2%,by Theorem 4. (cid:2)
Independent Events. If events A and B are such that
(14) P(A(cid:3)B)(cid:2)P(A)P(B),
c24.qxd 11/3/10 5:12 PM Page 1023
SEC. 24.3 Probability 1023
they are called independent events. Assuming P(A)(cid:8)0, P(B)(cid:8)0,we see from (11)–(13)
that in this case
P(AƒB)(cid:2)P(A), P(BƒA)(cid:2)P(B).
This means that the probability of Adoes not depend on the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of B, and conversely. This justifies the term “independent.”
Á
Independence of m Events. Similarly, m events A , , A are called independent if

where k(cid:2)2, 3,Á , m(cid:3)1.
Accordingly, three events A, B, C are independent if and only if
P(A(cid:3)B)(cid:2)P(A)P(B),
P(B(cid:3)C)(cid:2)P(B)P(C),
(16)
P(C(cid:3)A)(cid:2)P(C)P(A),
P(A(cid:3)B(cid:3)C)(cid:2)P(A)P(B)P(C).
Sampling. Our next example has to do with randomly drawing objects, one at a time,
from a given set of objects. This is called sampling from a population, and there are
two ways of sampling, as follows.
1. In sampling with replacement, the object that was drawn at random is placed back to
the given set and the set is mixed thoroughly. Then we draw the next object at random.
2. In sampling without replacement the object that was drawn is put aside.
EXAMPLE 6 Sampling With and Without Replacement
A box contains 10 screws, three of which are defective. Two screws are drawn at random. Find the probability
that neither of the two screws is defective.
Solution. We consider the events
A: First drawn screw nondefective.
B: Second drawn screw nondefective.
Clearly, P(A)(cid:2) 7 because 7 of the 10 screws are nondefective and we sample at random, so that each screw
10
has the same probability (1)of being picked. If we sample with replacement, the situation before the second
10
drawing is the same as at the beginning, and P(B)(cid:2) 7.The events are independent, and the answer is
10
P(A(cid:3)B)(cid:2)P(A)P(B)(cid:2)0.7 (cid:2) 0.7(cid:2)0.49(cid:2)49%.
If we sample without replacement, then P(A)(cid:2) 7,as before. If Ahas occurred, then there are 9 screws left
10
in the box, 3 of which are defective. Thus P(BƒA)(cid:2)6(cid:2)2,and Theorem 4 yields the answer
9 3
P(A(cid:3)B)(cid:2) 7 (cid:2) 2(cid:2)47%.

Permutations and Combinations
Permutations and combinations help in finding probabilities P(A)(cid:2)a kby systematically
>
counting the number a of points of which an event A consists; here, k is the number of
points of the sample space S. The practical difficulty is that a may often be surprisingly
large, so that actual counting becomes hopeless. For example, if in assembling some
instrument you need 10 different screws in a certain order and you want to draw them
c24.qxd 11/3/10 5:12 PM Page 1025
SEC. 24.4 Permutations and Combinations 1025
randomly from a box (which contains nothing else) the probability of obtaining them in
the required order is only 1 3,628,800 because there are
>
10!(cid:2)1(cid:2)2(cid:2)3(cid:2)4(cid:2)5(cid:2)6(cid:2)7(cid:2)8(cid:2)9(cid:2)10(cid:2)3,628,800
orders in which they can be drawn. Similarly, in many other situations the numbers of
orders, arrangements, etc. are often incredibly large. (If you are unimpressed, take 20
screws—how much bigger will the number be?)
Permutations
A permutationof given things (elementsor objects) is an arrangement of these things in
a row in some order. For example, for three letters a, b, c there are 3!(cid:2)1(cid:2)2(cid:2)3(cid:2)6
permutations: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba. This illustrates (a) in the following theorem.
THEOREM 1 Permutations
(a) Different things. The number of permutations of n different things taken
all at a time is
(1) n!(cid:2)1(cid:2)2(cid:2)3 Á n (read “n factorial”).
(b) Classes of equal things. If n given things can be divided into c classes of
alike things differing from class to class, then the number of permutations of
these things taken all at a time is
(2)
n !n
n !! Á
n !
(n 1(cid:4)n 2(cid:4) Á (cid:4)n c(cid:2)n)
1 2 c
Where n is the number of things in the jth class.
j
PROOF (a) There are n choices for filling the first place in the row. Then n(cid:3)1 things are still
available for filling the second place, etc.
(b)n alike things in class 1 make n !permutations collapse into a single permutation
1 1
(those in which class 1 things occupy the same n positions), etc., so that (2) follows
1
from (1). (cid:2)
EXAMPLE 1 Illustration of Theorem 1(b)
If a box contains 6 red and 4 blue balls, the probability of drawing first the red and then the blue balls is
P(cid:2)6!4! 10!(cid:2)1 210(cid:2)0.5%. (cid:2)
> >
A permutation of n things taken k at a time is a permutation containing only k of the
n given things. Two such permutations consisting of the same k elements, in a different
order, are different, by definition. For example, there are 6 different permutations of the
three letters a, b, c, taken two letters at a time, ab, ac, bc, ba, ca, cb.
A permutation of nthings taken kat a time with repetitionsis an arrangement obtained
by putting any given thing in the first position, any given thing, including a repetition of the
one just used, in the second, and continuing until kpositions are filled. For example, there
c24.qxd 11/3/10 5:12 PM Page 1026
1026 CHAP. 24 Data Analysis. Probability Theory
are 32(cid:2)9 different such permutations of a, b, c taken 2 letters at a time, namely, the
preceding 6 permutations and aa, bb, cc. You may prove (see Team Project 14):
THEOREM 2 Permutations
The number of different permutations of n different things taken k at a time without
repetitions is
(3a) n(n(cid:3)1)(n (cid:3)2)Á (n(cid:3)k(cid:4)1)(cid:2) n!
(n(cid:3)k)!
and with repetitions is
(3b) nk.
EXAMPLE 2 Illustration of Theorem 2
In an encrypted message the letters are arranged in groups of five letters, called words.From (3b) we see that
the number of different such words is
265(cid:2)11,881,376.
From (3a) it follows that the number of different such words containing each letter no more than once is
26! (26(cid:3)5)!(cid:2)26(cid:2)25(cid:2)24(cid:2)23(cid:2)22(cid:2)7,893,600. (cid:2)
>
Combinations
In a permutation, the order of the selected things is essential. In contrast, a combination
of given things means any selection of one or more things without regard to order.There
are two kinds of combinations, as follows.
The number of combinations of n different things, taken k at a time, without
repetitions is the number of sets that can be made up from the n given things, each set
containing k different things and no two sets containing exactly the same k things.
The number of combinations of ndifferent things, taken kat a time, with repetitions
is the number of sets that can be made up of k things chosen from the given n things,
each being used as often as desired.
For example, there are three combinations of the three letters a, b, c, taken two letters
at a time, without repetitions, namely, ab, ac, bc, and six such combinations with
repetitions, namely, ab, ac, bc, aa, bb, cc.
THEOREM 3 Combinations
The number of different combinations of n different things taken, k at a time, without
repetitions, is
n n! n(n(cid:3)1)Á (n(cid:3)k(cid:4)1)
(4a) akb(cid:2) k!(n (cid:3)k)! (cid:2) 1(cid:2)2Á k ,
and the number of those combinations with repetitions is
n(cid:4)k(cid:3)1
(4b) .

PROOF The statement involving (4a) follows from the first part of Theorem 2 by noting that there
are k! permutations of k things from the given n things that differ by the order of the
elements (see Theorem 1), but there is only a single combinationof those kthings of the
type characterized in the first statement of Theorem 3. The last statement of Theorem 3
can be proved by induction (see Team Project 14). (cid:2)

Random Variables.
Probability Distributions
In Sec. 24.1 we considered frequency distributions of data. These distributions show the
absolute or relative frequency of the data values. Similarly, a probability distribution
or, briefly, a distribution, shows the probabilities of events in an experiment. The quantity
that we observe in an experiment will be denoted by X and called a random variable
(or stochastic variable) because the value it will assume in the next trial depends on
chance, on randomness—if you roll a die, you get one of the numbers from 1 to 6, but
you don’t know which one will show up next. Thus X(cid:2)Number a die turns up is a
random variable. So is X(cid:2)Elasticity of rubber(elongation at break). (“Stochastic” means
related to chance.)
If we count (cars on a road, defective screws in a production, tosses until a die shows
the first Six), we have a discrete random variable and distribution. If we measure
(electric voltage, rainfall, hardness of steel), we have a continuous random variable and
distribution. Precise definitions follow. In both cases the distribution of Xis determined
by the distribution function
(1) F(x)(cid:2)P(X(cid:5)x);
this is the probability that in a trial, X will assume any value not exceeding x.
CAUTION! The terminology is not uniform. F(x) is sometimes also called the
cumulative distribution function.
c24.qxd 11/3/10 5:12 PM Page 1030
1030 CHAP. 24 Data Analysis. Probability Theory
For (1) to make sense in both the discrete and the continuous case we formulate con-
ditions as follows.
DEFINITION Random Variable
A random variableXis a function defined on the sample space Sof an experiment.
Its values are real numbers. For every number a the probability
P(X(cid:2)a)
with which X assumes a is defined. Similarly, for any interval I the probability
P(X (cid:4) I)
with which X assumes any value in I is defined.
Although this definition is very general, in practice only a very small number of distributions
will occur over and over again in applications.
From (1) we obtain the fundamental formula for the probability corresponding to an
interval a(cid:11)x(cid:5)b,
(2) P(a(cid:11)X(cid:5)b)(cid:2)F(b)(cid:3)F(a).
This follows because X(cid:5)a (“X assumes any value not exceeding a”) and a(cid:11)X(cid:5)b
(“X assumes any value in the interval a(cid:11)x(cid:5)b”) are mutually exclusive events, so that
by (1) and Axiom 3 of Definition 2 in Sec. 24.3
F(b)(cid:2)P(X(cid:5)b)(cid:2)P(X(cid:5)a)(cid:4)P(a(cid:11)X(cid:5)b)
(cid:2)F(a)(cid:4)P(a(cid:11)X(cid:5)b)
and subtraction of F(a) on both sides gives (2).
Discrete Random Variables and Distributions
By definition, a random variable Xand its distribution are discreteif Xassumes only finitely

1 1 2 2 3 3
whereas the probability P(X (cid:4) I)is zero for any interval Icontaining no possible value.
Clearly, the discrete distribution of X is also determined by the probability function
f(x) of X, defined by

where the first number is that shown on the first die and the second number that on the other die. Each such
outcome has probability 1 36. Now X(cid:2)2occurs in the case of the outcome (1, 1); X(cid:2)3in the case of the

Continuous Random Variables and Distributions
Discrete random variables appear in experiments in which we count (defectives in a
production, days of sunshine in Chicago, customers standing in a line, etc.). Continuous
random variables appear in experiments in which we measure(lengths of screws, voltage
in a power line, Brinell hardness of steel, etc.). By definition, a random variable X and
its distribution are of continuous type or, briefly, continuous, if its distribution function
F(x) [defined in (1)] can be given by an integral
(cid:4)x
(7) F(x)(cid:2) f(v) dv
(cid:6)(cid:7)
c24.qxd 11/3/10 5:12 PM Page 1033
SEC. 24.5 Random Variables. Probability Distributions 1033
(we write v because x is needed as the upper limit of the integral) whose integrand f(x),
called the density of the distribution, is nonnegative, and is continuous, perhaps except
for finitely many x-values. Differentiation gives the relation of f to F as
(8)
f(x)(cid:2)Fr
(x)
for every x at which f(x) is continuous.
From (2) and (7) we obtain the very important formula for the probability corresponding
to an interval:
(cid:4)b
(9) P(a(cid:11)X(cid:5)b)(cid:2)F(b)(cid:3)F(a)(cid:2) f(v) dv.
a
This is the analog of (5).
From (7) and P(S)(cid:2)1 (Sec. 24.3) we also have the analog of (6):
(cid:7)
(cid:4)
(10) f(v) dv(cid:2)1.
(cid:6)(cid:7)
Continuous random variables are simpler than discrete ones with respect to intervals.
Indeed, in the continuous case the four probabilities corresponding to a(cid:11)X(cid:5)b,
a(cid:11)X(cid:11)b, a(cid:5)X(cid:11)b, and a(cid:5)X(cid:5)b with any fixed a and b ((cid:10)a) are all the same.
Can you see why? (Answer. This probability is the area under the density curve, as in
Fig. 515, and does not change by adding or subtracting a single point in the interval of
integration.) This is different from the discrete case! (Explain.)
The next example illustrates notations and typical applications of our present formulas.

Mean and Variance of a Distribution
The mean (cid:2)and variance s2of a random variable Xand of its distribution are the theoretical
counterparts of the mean x and variance s2 of a frequency distribution in Sec. 24.1 and
serve a similar purpose. Indeed, the mean characterizes the central location and the variance
the spread (the variability) of the distribution. The mean (cid:2) (mu) is defined by
(a) (cid:2)(cid:2) a x j f (x j) (Discrete distribution)

(b) s2(cid:2) (x(cid:3)(cid:2))2f(x) dx (Continuous distribution).
(cid:6)(cid:7)
s(the positive square root of s2)is called the standard deviationof Xand its distribution.
f is the probability function or the density, respectively, in (a) and (b).
The mean (cid:2)is also denoted by E(X)and is called the expectationofXbecause it gives
the average value of X to be expected in many trials. Quantities such as (cid:2) and s2 that
measure certain properties of a distribution are called parameters. (cid:2)and s2are the two
most important ones. From (2) we see that
(3) s2(cid:10)0
(except for a discrete “distribution” with only one possible value, so that s2(cid:2)0). We

are useful in applications.

PROOF We prove (5) for a continuous distribution. To a small interval I of length ¢x on the
x-axis there corresponds the probability f(x)¢x [approximately; the area of a rectangle
of base ¢x and height f(x)]. Then the probability f(x)¢x must equal that for the
corresponding interval on the x*-axis, that is, f*(x*)¢x*, where f* is the density of X*
and ¢x* is the length of the interval on the x*-axis corresponding to I. Hence for
differentials we have f*(x*) dx* (cid:2)f(x) dx. Also, x*(cid:2)a (cid:4)a x by (4), so that (1b)

Expectation, Moments
Recall that (1) defines the expectation (the mean) of X, the value of X to be expected on
the average, written (cid:2)(cid:2)E(X).More generally, if g(x)is nonconstant and continuous for
all x, then g(X) is a random variable. Hence its mathematical expectation or, briefly, its
c24.qxd 11/3/10 5:12 PM Page 1038

expectation E(g(X))is the value of g(X)to be expected on the average, defined [similarly
to (1)] by

(7) E(g(X))(cid:2) a g(x j) f (x j) or E(g(X))(cid:2) g(x) f (x) dx.

In the first formula, fis the probability function of the discrete random variable X. In the
second formula, f is the density of the continuous random variable X. Important special
cases are the kth moment of X (where k(cid:2)1, 2,Á )
(cid:4)(cid:7)
(8) E(Xk)(cid:2) a x jkf (x j) or xkf (x) dx

This includes the first moment, the mean of X
(10) (cid:2)(cid:2)E(X) [(8) with k(cid:2)1].
It also includes the second central moment, the variance of X

Binomial, Poisson, and Hypergeometric
Distributions
These are the three most important discrete distributions, with numerous applications.
Binomial Distribution
The binomial distribution occurs in games of chance (rolling a die, see below, etc.),
quality inspection (e.g., counting of the number of defectives), opinion polls (counting
number of employees favoring certain schedule changes, etc.), medicine (e.g., recording
the number of patients who recovered on a new medication), and so on. The conditions
of its occurrence are as follows.
We are interested in the number of times an event A occurs in n independent trials. In
each trial the event Ahas the same probability P(A)(cid:2)p.Then in a trial, Awill notoccur
with probability q(cid:2)1(cid:3)p. In n trials the random variable that interests us is
X(cid:2)Number of times the event A occurs in n trials.
Á
X can assume the values 0, 1, , n, and we want to determine the corresponding
probabilities. Now X(cid:2)x means that A occurs in x trials and in n(cid:3)x trials it does not
occur. This may look as follows.
(1) A
AÁ
A B
BÁ
B.
Here B(cid:2)Acis the complement of A, meaning that Adoes not occur (Sec. 24.2). We now
use the assumption that the trials are independent, that is, they do not influence each other.
Hence (1) has the probability (see Sec. 24.3 on independent events)

(1*) ppÁ p (cid:8) qqÁ q(cid:2)pxqn(cid:6)x.
Now (1) is just one order of arranging x A’s and n(cid:3)x B’s. We now use Theorem 1(b)
in Sec. 24.4, which gives the number of permutations of n things (the n outcomes of the
n trials) consisting of 2 classes, class 1 containing the n (cid:2)x A’s and class 2 containing
1
the n(cid:3)n (cid:2)n(cid:3)x B’s. This number is
1
n! n
(cid:2) .
x!(n(cid:3)x)! axb
Accordingly, (1*), multiplied by this binomial coefficient, gives the probability P(X(cid:2)x)
of X(cid:2)x,that is, of obtaining Aprecisely xtimes in ntrials. Hence Xhas the probability
function
(2) f(x)(cid:2) n pxqn(cid:6)x (x(cid:2)0, 1,Á , n)

and f(x)(cid:2)0 otherwise. The distribution of X with probability function (2) is called the
binomial distribution or Bernoulli distribution. The occurrence of A is called success
(regardless of what it actually is; it may mean that you miss your plane or lose your watch)
and the nonoccurrence of Ais called failure.Figure 517 shows typical examples. Numeric
values can be obtained from Table A5 in App. 5 or from your CAS.
The mean of the binomial distribution is (see Team Project 16)
(3) (cid:2)(cid:2)np
and the variance is (see Team Project 16)
(4) s2(cid:2)npq.
For the symmetric caseof equal chance of success and failure (p(cid:2)q(cid:2)1)this gives the

The discrete distribution with infinitely many possible values and probability function

is called the Poisson distribution, named after S. D. Poisson (Sec. 18.5). Figure 518
shows (5) for some values of (cid:2). It can be proved that this distribution is obtained as a
limiting case of the binomial distribution, if we let p:0 and n:(cid:12) so that the mean
(cid:2)(cid:2)np approaches a finite value. (For instance, (cid:2)(cid:2)np may be kept constant.) The
Poisson distribution has the mean (cid:2) and the variance (see Team Project 16)
(6) s2(cid:2)(cid:2).
Figure 518 gives the impression that, with increasing mean, the spread of the distribution
increases, thereby illustrating formula (6), and that the distribution becomes more and
more (approximately) symmetric.

If the probability of producing a defective screw is p(cid:2)0.01,what is the probability that a lot of 100 screws
will contain more than 2 defectives?
Solution. The complementary event is Ac: Not more than2 defectives.For its probability we get, from the
binomial distribution with mean (cid:2)(cid:2)np(cid:2)1, the value [see (2)]

Since pis very small, we can approximate this by the much more convenient Poisson distribution with mean

Thus P(A)(cid:2)8.03%.Show that the binomial distribution gives P(A)(cid:2)7.94%,so that the Poisson approximation
(cid:2)
is quite good.
EXAMPLE 3 Parking Problems. Poisson Distribution
If on the average, 2 cars enter a certain parking lot per minute, what is the probability that during any given
minute 4 or more cars will enter the lot?
Solution. To understand that the Poisson distribution is a model of the situation, we imagine the minute to
be divided into very many short time intervals, let pbe the (constant) probability that a car will enter the lot
during any such short interval, and assume independence of the events that happen during those intervals. Then
we are dealing with a binomial distribution with very large nand very small p, which we can approximate by
the Poisson distribution with
(cid:2)(cid:2)np(cid:2)2,
because 2 cars enter on the average. The complementary event of the event “4 cars or more during a given
minute” is “3 cars or fewer enter the lot” and has the probability

Answer:14.3%. (Why did we consider that complement?)
Sampling with Replacement
This means that we draw things from a given set one by one, and after each trial we
replace the thing drawn (put it back to the given set and mix) before we draw the next
thing. This guarantees independence of trials and leads to the binomial distribution.
Indeed, if a box contains N things, for example, screws, M of which are defective, the
probability of drawing a defective screw in a trial is p(cid:2)M N. Hence the probability of
>
drawing a nondefective screw is q(cid:2)1(cid:3)p(cid:2)1(cid:3)M N,and (2) gives the probability of

Sampling without Replacement.
Hypergeometric Distribution
Sampling without replacement means that we return no screw to the box. Then we no
longer have independence of trials (why?), and instead of (7) the probability of drawing
x defectives in n trials is

The distribution with this probability function is called the hypergeometric distribution
(because its moment generating function (see Team Project 16) can be expressed by the
hypergeometric function defined in Sec. 5.4, a fact that we shall not use).

We want to draw random samples of two gaskets from a box containing 10 gaskets, three of which are defective.

If N, M, and N(cid:3)Mare large compared with n, then it does not matter too much whether
we sample with or without replacement, and in this case the hypergeometric distribution
may be approximated by the binomial distribution (with p(cid:2)M N), which is somewhat

simpler.
Hence, in sampling from an indefinitely large population (“infinite population”), we
may use the binomial distribution, regardless of whether we sample with or without
replacement.

Normal Distribution
Turning from discrete to continuous distributions, in this section we discuss the normal
distribution. This is the most important continuous distribution because in applications many
random variables are normal random variables (that is, they have a normal distribution)
or they are approximately normal or can be transformed into normal random variables in a
relatively simple fashion. Furthermore, the normal distribution is a useful approximation of
more complicated distributions, and it also occurs in the proofs of various statistical tests.
The normal distribution or Gauss distribution is defined as the distribution with the
density

s12p c 2 a s b d
where exp is the exponential function with base
e(cid:2)2.718Á
.This is simpler than it may
at first look. f(x) has these features (see also Fig. 519).
1. (cid:2) is the mean and s the standard deviation.
2. 1 (s12p)is a constant factor that makes the area under the curve of f(x)from (cid:3)(cid:12)
>
to (cid:12) equal to 1, as it must be by (10), Sec. 24.5.
3. The curve of f(x) is symmetric with respect to x(cid:2)(cid:2) because the exponent is
quadratic. Hence for (cid:2)(cid:2)0it is symmetric with respect to the y-axis x(cid:2) 0(Fig.519,
“bell-shaped curves”).
4. The exponential function in (1) goes to zero very fast—the faster the smaller the
standard deviation s is, as it should be (Fig. 519).

This integral cannot be integrated by one of the methods of calculus. But this is no serious
handicap because its values can be obtained from Table A7 in App. 5 or from your CAS.
These values are needed in working with the normal distribution. The curve of £(z) is
S-shaped. It increases monotone (why?) from 0 to 1 and intersects the vertical axis at 1

of Xto be observed will lie between (cid:2) (cid:6) s,about 95%between (cid:2) (cid:6) 2s,and practically all
between the three-sigma limits(cid:2) (cid:6) 3s.More precisely, by Table A7 in App. 5,

In tests (Chap. 25) we shall ask, conversely, for the intervals that correspond to certain
given probabilities; practically most important are the probabilities of 95%, 99%, and
99.9%. For these, Table A8 in App. 5 gives the answers (cid:2) (cid:6) 2s, (cid:2) (cid:6) 2.6s, and
(cid:2) (cid:6) 3.3s, respectively. More precisely,

Working with the Normal Tables A7 and A8 in App. 5
There are two normal tables in App. 5, Tables A7 and A8. If you want probabilities, use
Table A7. If probabilities are given and corresponding intervals or x-values are wanted,
use Table A8. The following examples are typical. Do them with care, verifying all values,
and don’t just regard them as dull exercises for your software. Make sketches of the density
to see whether the results look reasonable.

Distributions of Several Random Variables
Distributions of two or more random variables are of interest for two reasons:
1. They occur in experiments in which we observe several random variables, for
example, carbon content X and hardness Y of steel, amount of fertilizer X and yield of
corn Y, height X , weight X , and blood pressure X of persons, and so on.
1 2 3
2. They will be needed in the mathematical justification of the methods of statistics in
Chap. 25.
In this section we consider two random variables X and Y or, as we also say, a two-
dimensional random variable(X, Y).For (X, Y)the outcome of a trial is a pair of numbers
X(cid:2)x, Y(cid:2)y, briefly (X, Y)(cid:2)(x, y), which we can plot as a point in the XY-plane.
The two-dimensional probability distribution of the random variable (X, Y)is given
by the distribution function
(1) F(x, y)(cid:2)P(X(cid:5)x, Y(cid:5)y).
This is the probability that in a trial, X will assume any value not greater than x and in
the same trial, Y will assume any value not greater than y. This corresponds to the blue
region in Fig. 522, which extends to (cid:3)(cid:12) to the left and below. F(x, y) determines the

As before, in the two-dimensional case we shall also have discrete and continuous
random variables and distributions.

distribution discreteif (X, Y)can assume only finitely many or at most countably infinitely

p may be 0 for certain pairs of subscripts i, j). Then we define the probability function

Continuous Two-Dimensional Distributions
In analogy to the case of a single random variable (Sec. 24.5) we call (X, Y) and its
distribution continuousif the corresponding distribution function F(x, y)can be given by
a double integral

(cid:6)(cid:7) (cid:6)(cid:7)
whose integrand f, called the density of (X, Y), is nonnegative everywhere, and is
continuous, possibly except on finitely many curves.
From (6) we obtain the probability that (X, Y)assume any value in a rectangle (Fig. 523)
given by the formula

This is a rather natural idea, without counterpart for a single random variable. It amounts

P(X(cid:2)x, Y arbitrary). Since (X, Y) is discrete, so is X. We get its probability function,
call it f (x), from the probability function f(x, y) of (X, Y) by summing over y:

where we sum all the values of f(x, y) that are not 0 for that x.
From (9) we see that the distribution function of the marginal distribution of X is
(10) F 1(x)(cid:2)P(X(cid:5)x, Y arbitrary)(cid:2) a f 1(x*).

Similarly, the probability function
(11) f 2( y)(cid:2)P(X arbitrary, Y(cid:5)y)(cid:2) a f (x, y)
x
determines the marginal distributionof Yin (X, Y). Here we sum all the values of f(x, y)that
are not zero for the corresponding y. The distribution function of this marginal distribution is
(12) F 2( y)(cid:2)P(X arbitrary, Y(cid:5)y)(cid:2) a f 2( y*).

EXAMPLE 3 Marginal Distributions of a Discrete Two-Dimensional Random Variable
In drawing 3 cards with replacement from a bridge deck let us consider
(X, Y), X(cid:2)Number of queens, Y(cid:2)Number of kings or aces.
The deck has 52 cards. These include 4 queens, 4 kings, and 4 aces. Hence in a single trial a queen has probability

SEC. 24.9 Distributions of Several Random Variables 1055
Marginal Distributions of a Continuous Distribution
This is conceptually the same as for discrete distributions, with probability functions and
sums replaced by densities and integrals. For a continuous random variable (X, Y) with
density f(x, y) we now have the marginal distribution of X in (X, Y), defined by the
distribution function
(cid:4)x
(13) F (x)(cid:2)P(X(cid:5)x, (cid:3)(cid:12) (cid:11) Y(cid:11) (cid:12))(cid:2) f (x*) dx*

(cid:4)(cid:7)

Interchanging the roles of Xand Y, we obtain the marginal distributionof Yin (X, Y)
with the distribution function
(cid:4)y

holds for all (x, y). Otherwise these random variables are said to be dependent. These
definitions are suggested by the corresponding definitions for events in Sec. 24.3.
Necessary and sufficient for independence is
(18) f(x, y) (cid:2)f (x)f (y)

for all x and y. Here the f’s are the above probability functions if (X, Y) is discrete or
those densities if (X, Y) is continuous. (See Prob. 20.)

throughout Chap. 25. The distribution of such a random variable X(cid:2)(X ,Á , X ) is

Otherwise these random variables are said to be dependent.
Functions of Random Variables
When n(cid:2)2,we write X (cid:2)X, X (cid:2)Y, x (cid:2)x, x (cid:2)y.Taking a nonconstant continuous
1 2 1 2
function g(x, y)defined for all x, y, we obtain a random variable Z(cid:2)g(X, Y).For example,
if we roll two dice and Xand Yare the numbers the dice turn up in a trial, then Z(cid:2)X(cid:4)Y
is the sum of those two numbers (see Fig. 514 in Sec. 24.5).
In the case of a discreterandom variable (X, Y)we may obtain the probability function
f(z) of Z(cid:2)g(X, Y) by summing all f(x, y) for which g(x, y) equals the value of z
considered; thus
(20) f (z)(cid:2)P(Z(cid:2)z) (cid:2) aa f (x, y).
g(x,y)(cid:2)z
Hence the distribution function of Z is
(21) F(z) (cid:2)P(Z(cid:5)z) (cid:2) aa f (x, y)
g(x,y)(cid:5)z
where we sum all values of f(x, y) for which g(x, y) (cid:5)z.
In the case of a continuous random variable (X, Y) we similarly have
(cid:4)(cid:4)
(22) F(z) (cid:2)P(Z(cid:5)z) (cid:2) f(x, y) dx dy
g(x,y)(cid:5)z
where for each z we integrate the density f(x, y) of (X, Y) over the region g(x, y)(cid:5)z in
the xy-plane, the boundary curve of this region being g(x, y) (cid:2)z.

is called the mathematical expectation or, briefly, the expectation of g(X, Y). Here it is
assumed that the double series converges absolutely and the integral of ƒg(x, y)ƒf(x, y)

we have from (23)
(24) E(ag(X, Y)(cid:4)bh(X, Y)) (cid:2)aE(g(X, Y)) (cid:4)bE(h(X, Y)).
An important special case is
E(X(cid:4)Y)(cid:2)E(X)(cid:4)E(Y),
and by induction we have the following result.
THEOREM 1 Addition of Means
The mean(expectation) of a sum of random variables equals the sum of the means
(expectations), that is,
(25) E(X (cid:4)X (cid:4) Á (cid:4)X )(cid:2)E(X )(cid:4)E(X )(cid:4) Á (cid:4)E(X ).

Furthermore, we readily obtain
THEROEM 2 Multiplication of Means

product of the means (expectations), that is,
(26) E(X X Á X )(cid:2)E(X )E(X )Á E(X ).

PROOF If X and Y are independent random variables (both discrete or both continuous), then
E(XY)(cid:2)E(X)E(Y). In fact, in the discrete case we have

and in the continuous case the proof of the relation is similar. Extension to nindependent
random variables gives (26), and Theorem 2 is proved. (cid:2)
Addition of Variances
This is another matter of practical importance that we shall need. As before, let Z(cid:2)X(cid:4)Y
and denote the mean and variance of Zby (cid:2)and s2.Then we first have (see Team Project
20(a) in Problem Set 24.6)
s2(cid:2)E([Z (cid:3)(cid:2)]2)(cid:2)E(Z2)(cid:3)[E(Z)]2.
From (24) we see that the first term on the right equals
E(Z2)(cid:2)E(X2(cid:4)2XY(cid:4)Y2)(cid:2)E(X2)(cid:4)2E(XY)(cid:4)E(Y2).
For the second term on the right we obtain from Theorem 1
[E(Z)]2(cid:2)[E(X)(cid:4)E(Y)]2(cid:2)[E(X)]2(cid:4)2E(X)E(Y)(cid:4)[E(Y)]2.
By substituting these expressions into the formula for s2 we have
s2(cid:2)E(X2)(cid:3)[E(X)]2(cid:4)E(Y2)(cid:3)[E(Y)]2
(cid:4)2[E(XY)(cid:3)E(X)E(Y)].
From Team Project 20, Sec. 24.6, we see that the expression in the first line on the right
is the sum of the variances of Xand Y, which we denote by s2and s2,respectively. The
1 2
quantity in the second line (except for the factor 2) is
(27) s (cid:2)E(XY)(cid:3)E(X)E(Y)
XY
and is called the covariance of X and Y. Consequently, our result is
(28) s2(cid:2)s2(cid:4)s2(cid:4)2s .
1 2 XY
If X and Y are independent, then
E(XY)(cid:2)E(X)E(Y);
hence s (cid:2)0, and
XY

Extension to more than two variables gives the basic

variances of these variables.

remember that Theorem 3 holds only for independent variables.
This is the end of Chap. 24 on probability theory. Most of the concepts, methods, and
special distributions discussed in this chapter will play a fundamental role in the next
chapter, which deals with methods of statistical inference, that is, conclusions from
samples to populations, whose unknown properties we want to know and try to discover
by looking at suitable properties of samples that we have obtained.

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Data Analysis. Probability Theory
A random experiment, briefly called experiment, is a process in which the result
(“outcome”) depends on “chance” (effects of factors unknown to us). Examples are
games of chance with dice or cards, measuring the hardness of steel, observing weather
conditions, or recording the number of accidents in a city. (Thus the word “experiment”
is used here in a much wider sense than in common language.) The outcomes are
regarded as points (elements) of a set S, called the sample space, whose subsets are
called events. For events Ewe define a probabilityP(E)by the axioms (Sec. 24.3)

Summary of Chapter 24 1061
These axioms are motivated by properties of frequency distributions of data
(Sec. 24.1).
The complement Ec of E has the probability
(2) P(Ec)(cid:2)1(cid:3)P(E).
The conditional probability of an event B under the condition that an event A
happens is (Sec. 24.3)

(4) P(A(cid:3)B)(cid:2)P(A)P(B).
With an experiment we associate a random variableX. This is a function defined
on S whose values are real numbers; furthermore, X is such that the probability
P(X(cid:2)a)with which Xassumes any value a, and the probability P(a(cid:11)X(cid:5)b)with
which X assumes any value in an interval a(cid:11)X(cid:5)b are defined (Sec. 24.5). The
probability distribution of X is determined by the distribution function
(5) F(x)(cid:2)P(X(cid:5)x).
In applications there are two important kinds of random variables: those of the
discretetype, which appear if we count (defective items, customers in a bank, etc.)
and those of the continuous type, which appear if we measure (length, speed,
temperature, weight, etc.).
A discrete random variable has a probability function

Its mean (cid:2) and variance s2 are (Sec. 24.6)

respectively; their distributions are called marginal distributions. If both X and Y
are discrete, then (X, Y) has a probability function
f(x, y) (cid:2)P(X(cid:2)x, Y(cid:2)y).
If both X and Y are continuous, then (X, Y) has a density f(x, y).

Mathematical Statistics
In probability theory we set up mathematical models of processes that are affected by
“chance.” In mathematical statistics or, briefly, statistics, we check these models against
the observable reality. This is called statistical inference. It is done by sampling, that
is, by drawing random samples, briefly called samples. These are sets of values from a
much larger set of values that could be studied, called the population. An example is
10 diameters of screws drawn from a large lot of screws. Sampling is done in order to
see whether a model of the population is accurate enough for practical purposes. If this
is the case, the model can be used for predictions, decisions, and actions, for instance, in
planning productions, buying equipment, investing in business projects, and so on.
Most important methods of statistical inference are estimation of parameters(Secs.25.2),
determination of confidence intervals(Sec. 25.3), and hypothesis testing(Sec. 25.4, 25.7,
25.8), with application to quality control(Sec. 25.5) and acceptance sampling(Sec. 25.6).
In the last section (25.9) we give an introduction to regressionand correlation analysis,
which concern experiments involving two variables.

Introduction. Random Sampling
Mathematical statistics consists of methods for designing and evaluating random
experiments to obtain information about practical problems, such as exploring the relation
between iron content and density of iron ore, the quality of raw material or manufactured
products, the efficiency of air-conditioning systems, the performance of certain cars, the
effect of advertising, the reactions of consumers to a new product, etc.
Random variables occur more frequently in engineering (and elsewhere) than one
would think. For example, properties of mass-produced articles (screws, lightbulbs, etc.)
always show random variation, due to small (uncontrollable!) differences in raw material
or manufacturing processes. Thus the diameter of screws is a random variable X and we
have nondefective screws, with diameter between given tolerance limits, and defective
screws, with diameter outside those limits. We can ask for the distribution of X, for the
percentage of defective screws to be expected, and for necessary improvements of the
production process.
Samples are selected from populations—20 screws from a lot of 1000, 100 of 5000
voters, 8 beavers in a wildlife conservation project—because inspecting the entire
population would be too expensive, time-consuming, impossible or even senseless (think
1063
c25.qxd 11/3/10 6:21 PM Page 1064
1064 CHAP. 25 Mathematical Statistics
of destructive testing of lightbulbs or dynamite). To obtain meaningful conclusions,
samples must be random selections. Each of the 1000 screws must have the same chance
of being sampled (of being drawn when we sample), at least approximately. Only then
will the sample mean x (cid:2)(x (cid:4) Á (cid:4)x ) 20 (Sec. 24.1) of a sample of size n(cid:2)20

(or any other n) be a good approximation of the population mean (cid:2) (Sec. 24.6); and the
accuracy of the approximation will generally improve with increasing n, as we shall see.
Similarly for other parameters (standard deviation, variance, etc.).
Independent sample values will be obtained in experiments with an infinite sample
space S(Sec. 24.2), certainly for the normal distribution. This is also true in sampling with
replacement. It is approximately true in drawing smallsamples from a large finite population
(for instance, 5 or 10 of 1000 items). However, if we sample without replacement from a
small population, the effect of dependence of sample values may be considerable.
Random numbershelp in obtaining samples that are in fact random selections. This
is sometimes not easy to accomplish because there are many subtle factors that can bias
sampling (by personal interviews, by poorly working machines, by the choice of
nontypical observation conditions, etc.). Random numbers can be obtained from a
random number generator in Maple, Mathematica, or other systems listed on p. 789.
(The numbers are not truly random, as they would be produced in flipping coins or
rolling dice, but are calculated by a tricky formula that produces numbers that do have
practically all the essential features of true randomness. Because these numbers
eventually repeat, they must not be used in cryptography, for example, where true
randomness is required.)
EXAMPLE 1 Random Numbers from a Random Number Generator
To select a sample of size n(cid:2)10from 80 given ball bearings, we number the bearings from 1 to 80. We then
let the generator randomly produce 10 of the integers from 1 to 80 and include the bearings with the numbers
obtained in our sample, for example.

or whatever.

Random numbers are also contained in (older) statistical tables.
Representing and processing data were considered in Sec. 24.1 in connection with
frequency distributions. These are the empirical counterparts of probability distributions
and helped motivating axioms and properties in probability theory. The new aspect in this
chapter is randomness: the data are samples selected randomly from a population.
Accordingly, we can immediately make the connection to Sec. 24.1, using stem-and-leaf
plots, box plots, and histograms for representing samples graphically.
Also, we now call the mean x in (5), Sec. 24.1, the sample mean

and its positive square root s the sample standard deviation. x, s2, and s are called
parameters of a sample; they will be needed throughout this chapter.
25.2
Point Estimation of Parameters
Beginning in this section, we shall discuss the most basic practical tasks in statistics and
corresponding statistical methods to accomplish them. The first of them is point estimation
of parameters, that is, of quantities appearing in distributions, such as pin the binomial
distribution and (cid:2) and s in the normal distribution.
A point estimateof a parameter is a number (point on the real line), which is computed
from a given sample and serves as an approximation of the unknown exact value of the
parameter of the population. An interval estimate is an interval (“confidence interval”)
obtained from a sample; such estimates will be considered in the next section. Estimation
of parameters is of great practical importance in many applications.
As an approximation of the mean (cid:2) of a population we may take the mean x of a
corresponding sample. This gives the estimate (cid:2)ˆ (cid:2)x for (cid:2), that is,
(1) (cid:2)ˆ (cid:2)x(cid:2) 1 (x (cid:4) Á (cid:4)x )
n 1 n
where n is the sample size. Similarly, an estimate sˆ2 for the variance of a population is
the variance s2 of a corresponding sample, that is,
n
1
(2) sˆ2(cid:2)s2(cid:2) n(cid:3)1 a (x j(cid:3)x)2.
j(cid:2)1
Clearly, (1) and (2) are estimates of parameters for distributions in which (cid:2) or s2
appear explicity as parameters, such as the normal and Poisson distributions. For the
binomial distribution, p(cid:2)(cid:2) n [see (3) in Sec. 24.7]. From (1) we thus obtain for p
>
the estimate
x
(3) pˆ (cid:2) .
n
We mention that (1) is a special case of the so-called method of moments. In this
method the parameters to be estimated are expressed in terms of the moments of the
distribution (see Sec. 24.6). In the resulting formulas, those moments of the distribution
are replaced by the corresponding moments of the sample. This gives the estimates. Here

Maximum Likelihood Method
Another method for obtaining estimates is the so-called maximum likelihood methodof
R.A.Fisher [Messenger Math.41(1912), 155–160]. To explain it, we consider a discrete
(or continuous) random variable X whose probability function (or density) f(x) depends
on a single parameter u. We take a corresponding sample of n independent values
Á
x , , x . Then in the discrete case the probability that a sample of size n consists
1 n
precisely of those n values is
(4) l(cid:2)f(x )f(x ) Á f(x ).
1 2 n
In the continuous case the probability that the sample consists of values in the small
intervals x (cid:6)x(cid:6)x (cid:4) ¢x (j(cid:2)1, 2,Á , n) is
j j
(5) f(x )¢x f(x )¢x Á f(x )¢x(cid:2)l(¢x)n.
1 2 n
Á
Since f(x ) depends on u, the function l in (5) given by (4) depends on x , , x and u.
j 1 n
Á
We imagine x , , x to be given and fixed. Then l is a function of u, which is called
1 n
the likelihood function. The basic idea of the maximum likelihood method is quite simple,
as follows. We choose that approximation for the unknown value of u for which l is as
large as possible. If lis a differentiable function of u,a necessary condition for lto have
a maximum in an interval (not at the boundary) is
0l

(We write a partial derivative, because l depends also on x , , x .) A solution of (6)

Confidence Intervals
Confidence intervals1for an unknown parameter uof some distribution (e.g., u(cid:2)(cid:2))are
intervals u (cid:6)u(cid:6)u that contain u, not with certainty but with a high probability g,
1 2
which we can choose (95% and 99% are popular). Such an interval is calculated from a
sample. g(cid:2)95% means probability 1(cid:3)g(cid:2)5% (cid:2) 1 of being wrong—one of about
20
20 such intervals will not contain u.Instead of writing u (cid:6)u(cid:6)u ,we denote this more
1 2
distinctly by writing
(1) CONF {u (cid:6)u(cid:6)u }.
g 1 2
Such a special symbol, CONF, seems worthwhile in order to avoid the misunderstanding
that u must lie between u and u .
1 2
g is called the confidence level, and u and u are called the lower and upper
1 2
confidence limits. They depend on g. The larger we choose g, the smaller is the error
probability 1(cid:3)g,but the longer is the confidence interval. If g:1,then its length goes
to infinity. The choice of g depends on the kind of application. In taking no umbrella, a
5%chance of getting wet is not tragic. In a medical decision of life or death, a 5%chance
of being wrong may be too large and a 1% chance of being wrong (g(cid:2)99%) may be
more desirable.
Confidence intervals are more valuable than point estimates (Sec. 25.2). Indeed, we can
take the midpoint of (1) as an approximation of uand half the length of (1) as an “error bound”
(not in the strict sense of numerics, but except for an error whose probability we know).
Á
u and u in (1) are calculated from a sample x , , x .These are nobservations of a
1 2 1 n
Á
random variable X. Now comes a standard trick. We regard x , , x as single
1 n
Á
observations of n random variables X , , X (with the same distribution, namely, that
1 n
of X). Then u (cid:2)u (x ,Á , x )and u (cid:2)u (x ,Á , x )in (1) are observed values of two
1 1 1 n 2 2 1 n
random variables (cid:9) (cid:2)(cid:9) (X ,Á , X ) and (cid:9) (cid:2)(cid:9) (X ,Á , X ). The condition (1)
1 1 1 n 2 2 1 n
involving g can now be written
(2) P((cid:9) (cid:6)u(cid:6)(cid:9) )(cid:2)g.
1 2
Let us see what all this means in concrete practical cases.
In each case in this section we shall first state the steps of obtaining a confidence interval
in the form of a table, then consider a typical example, and finally justify those steps
theoretically.
1JERZY NEYMAN (1894–1981), American statistician, developed the theory of confidence intervals (Annals
of Mathematical Statistics6(1935), 111–116).

Derivation of (3) in Table 25.1. Sampling from a normal distribution gives independent

For the value g(cid:2)0.95 we obtain z(D)(cid:2)1.960 from Table A8 in App. 5, as used in
Example 1. For g(cid:2)0.9, 0.99, 0.999 we get the other values of c listed in Table 25.1.
Finally, all we have to do is to convert the inequality in (6) into one for (cid:2) and insert
observed values obtained from the sample. We multiply (cid:3)c(cid:6)Z(cid:6)cby (cid:3)1and then by

Figure 528 compares the curve of the density of the t-distribution with that of the normal
distribution. The latter is steeper. This illustrates that Table 25.1 (which uses more
information, namely, the known value of s2) yields shorter confidence intervals than
Table25.2. This is confirmed in Fig. 529, which also gives an idea of the gain by increasing
the sample size.

Confidence Intervals for Parameters
of Other Distributions
The methods in Tables 25.1–25.3 for confidence intervals for (cid:2) and s2 are designed for
the normal distribution. We now show that they can also be applied to other distributions
if we use large samples.
We know that if X ,Á , X are independent random variables with the same mean (cid:2)
1 n
and the same variance s2,then their sum Y (cid:2)X (cid:4) Á (cid:4)X has the following properties.
n 1 n
(A) Y has the mean n(cid:2) and the variance ns2 (by Theorems 1 and 3 in Sec. 24.9).
n
(B) If those variables are normal, then Y is normal (by Theorem 1).
n
If those random variables are not normal, then (B) is not applicable. However, for large
nthe random variable Y is still approximatelynormal. This follows from the central limit
n
theorem, which is one of the most fundamental results in probability theory.

A proof can be found in Ref. [G3] listed in App. 1.
Hence, when applying Tables 25.1–25.3 to a nonnormal distribution, we must use
sufficiently large samples. As a rule of thumb, if the sample indicates that the skewness
of the distribution (the asymmetry; see Team Project 20(d), Problem Set 24.6) is small,
use at least n(cid:2)20 for the mean and at least n(cid:2)50 for the variance.

Testing of Hypotheses. Decisions
The ideas of confidence intervals and of tests2 are the two most important ideas in modern
statistics. In a statistical testwe make inference from sample to population through testing a
hypothesis, resulting from experience or observations, from a theory or a quality requirement,
and so on. In many cases the result of a test is used as a basis for a decision, for instance, to
2Beginning around 1930, a systematic theory of tests was developed by NEYMAN (see Sec. 25.3) and EGON
SHARPE PEARSON (1895–1980), English statistician, the son of Karl Pearson (see the footnote on p. 1086).

>
(and other tests, of course), to apply some medication, depending on a test of its effect; to
proceed with a marketing strategy, depending on a test of consumer reactions, etc.
Let us explain such a test in terms of a typical example and introduce the corresponding
standard notions of statistical testing.
EXAMPLE 1 Test of a Hypothesis. Alternative. Significance Level A
We want to buy 100 coils of a certain kind of wire, provided we can verify the manufacturer’s claim that the
wire has a breaking limit (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)200 lb(or more). This is a test of the hypothesis(also called null hypothesis)
0
(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:2)200.We shall not buy the wire if the (statistical) test shows that actually (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:7)(cid:2) ,the wire is
0 1 0
weaker, the claim does not hold. (cid:2) is called the alternative(or alternative hypothesis) of the test. We shall
1
accept the hypothesis if the test suggests that it is true, except for a small error probability a, called the
significance level of the test. Otherwise we reject the hypothesis. Hence a is the probability of rejecting a
hypothesis although it is true. The choice of ais up to us. 5%and 1%are popular values.
For the test we need a sample. We randomly select 25 coils of the wire, cut a piece from each coil, and
determine the breaking limit experimentally. Suppose that this sample of n(cid:2)25values of the breaking limit
has the mean x(cid:2)197 lb(somewhat less than the claim!) and the standard deviation s(cid:2)6 lb.
At this point we could only speculate whether this difference 197(cid:3)200(cid:2)(cid:3)3is due to randomness, is a
chance effect, or whether it is significant, due to the actually inferior quality of the wire. To continue beyond
speculation requires probability theory, as follows.
We assume that the breaking limit is normally distributed. (This assumption could be tested by the method
in Sec. 25.7. Or we could remember the central limit theorem (Sec. 25.3) and take a still larger sample.) Then
X(cid:3)(cid:2)
T(cid:2) 0

in (11), Sec. 25.3, with (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) has a t-distributionwith n(cid:3)1degrees of freedom (n(cid:3)1(cid:2)24for our sample).
0
Also x(cid:2)197and s(cid:2)6are observed values of X and Sto be used later. We can now choose a significance
level, say, a(cid:2)5%. From Table A9 in App. 5 or from a CAS we then obtain a critical value c such that
P(T(cid:6)c)(cid:2)a(cid:2)5%. For P(T(cid:6)(cid:2) c)(cid:2)1(cid:3)a(cid:2)95% the table gives (cid:2) c (cid:2)1.71, so that c(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:2) c (cid:2)(cid:3)1.71
because of the symmetry of the distribution (Fig. 532).
We now reason as follows—this is the crucial ideaof the test. If the hypothesis is true, we have a chance
of only a ((cid:2)5%)that we observe a value t of T (calculated from a sample) that will fall between (cid:3)(cid:14) and
(cid:3)1.71.Hence, if we nevertheless do observe such a t, we assert that the hypothesis cannot be true and we reject
it. Then we accept the alternative. If, however, t(cid:8)c,we accept the hypothesis.
A simple calculation finally gives t(cid:2)(197(cid:3)200) (6 125)(cid:2)(cid:3)2.5 as an observed value of T. Since
> >
(cid:3)2.5(cid:7)(cid:3)1.71,we reject the hypothesis (the manufacturer’s claim) and accept the alternative (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) (cid:7)200,
1 (cid:2)
the wire seems to be weaker than claimed.

c25.qxd 11/3/10 6:21 PM Page 1079
SEC. 25.4 Testing of Hypotheses. Decisions 1079
a critical value c from the distribution of (cid:9)ˆ, assuming the hypothesis to be true. (In the
example, (cid:9)ˆ (cid:2)T, and c is, obtained from P(T(cid:6)c)(cid:2)a.)
5. Use a sample x ,Á , x to determine an observed value uˆ(cid:2)g(x ,Á , x ) of (cid:9)ˆ.
1 n 1 n
(t in the example.)
6. Accept or reject the hypothesis, depending on the size of uˆ relative to c. (t(cid:7)c in
the example, rejection of the hypothesis.)
Two important facts require further discussion and careful attention. The first is the
choice of an alternative. In the example, (cid:2) (cid:7)(cid:2) , but other applications may require
1 0
(cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2) or (cid:2) (cid:16)(cid:2) . The second fact has to do with errors. We know that a (the
1 0 1 0
significance level of the test) is the probability of rejecting a true hypothesis. And we
shall discuss the probability b of accepting a false hypothesis.
One-Sided and Two-Sided Alternatives (Fig. 533)
Let u be an unknown parameter in a distribution, and suppose that we want to test the
hypothesis u(cid:2)u . Then there are three main kinds of alternatives, namely,
0
(1) u(cid:5)u
0
(2) u(cid:7)u
0
(3) u(cid:16)u .
0
(1) and (2) are one-sided alternatives, and (3) is a two-sided alternative.
We call rejection region (or critical region) the region such that we reject the
①
hypothesis if the observed value in the test falls in this region. In the critical c lies to
the right of u because so does the alternative. Hence the rejection region extends to
0
②
the right. This is called a right-sided test. In the critical c lies to the left of u (as
0
in Example 1), the rejection region extends to the left, and we have a left-sided test
③
(Fig. 533, middle part). These are one-sided tests. In we have two rejection regions.
This is called a two-sided test (Fig. 533, lower part).

All three kinds of alternatives occur in practical problems. For example, (1) may arise
if u is the maximum tolerable inaccuracy of a voltmeter or some other instrument.
0
Alternative (2) may occur in testing strength of material, as in Example 1. Finally, u in
0
(3) may be the diameter of axle-shafts, and shafts that are too thin or too thick are equally
undesirable, so that we have to watch for deviations in both directions.
Errors in Tests
Tests always involve risks of making false decisions:
(I) Rejecting a true hypothesis (Type I error).
a(cid:2)Probability of making a Type I error.
(II) Accepting a false hypothesis (Type II error).
b(cid:2)Probability of making a Type II error.
Clearly, we cannot avoid these errors because no absolutely certain conclusions about
populations can be drawn from samples. But we show that there are ways and means of
choosing suitable levels of risks, that is, of values aand b.The choice of adepends on the
nature of the problem (e.g., a small risk a(cid:2)1% is used if it is a matter of life or death).
Let us discuss this systematically for a test of a hypothesis u(cid:2)u against an alternative
0
that is a single number u , for simplicity. We let u (cid:5)u , so that we have a right-sided
1 1 0
test. For a left-sided or a two-sided test the discussion is quite similar.

two possibilities of making an error, as follows.
Type I Error (see Table 25.4). The hypothesis is true but is rejected (hence the

making such an error equals
(5) P((cid:9)ˆ (cid:5)c) (cid:2)a.

a is called the significance level of the test, as mentioned before.
Type II Error (see Table 25.4). The hypothesis is false but is accepted because
(cid:9)ˆ
assumes a value uˆ(cid:6)c. The probability of making such an error is denoted by b; thus

h(cid:2)1(cid:3)b is called the power of the test. Obviously, the power h is the probability of
avoiding a Type II error.

Formulas (5) and (6) show that both aand bdepend on c, and we would like to choose
c so that these probabilities of making errors are as small as possible. But the important
Figure 534 shows that these are conflicting requirements because to let adecrease we must
shift cto the right, but then bincreases. In practice we first choose a (5%,sometimes 1%),
then determine c, and finally compute b.If bis large so that the power h(cid:2)1(cid:3)bis small,
we should repeat the test, choosing a larger sample, for reasons that will appear shortly.

If the alternative is not a single number but is of the form (1)–(3), then b becomes a
function of u. This function b(u) is called the operating characteristic (OC) of the test
and its curve the OC curve. Clearly, in this case h(cid:2)1(cid:3)b also depends on u. This
function h(u) is called the power function of the test. (Examples will follow.)
Of course, from a test that leads to the acceptance of a certain hypothesis u , it does

notfollow that this is the only possible hypothesis or the best possible hypothesis. Hence
the terms “not reject” or “fail to reject” are perhaps better than the term “accept.”

Figure 536 shows that the corresponding OC curve is steeper than that for n(cid:2)10.This means that the increase
of n has led to an improvement of the test. In any practical case, n is chosen as small as possible but so
large that the test brings out deviations between (cid:2) and (cid:2) that are of practical interest. For instance, if
0
deviations of (cid:12)2 units are of interest, we see from Fig. 536 that n(cid:2)10 is much too small because when

x(cid:2)4482 kg, and the sample standard deviation was s(cid:2)115 kg (N. C. Wiley, 41st Annual Meeting of the
American Society for Testing Materials). Assuming that the tensile strength is a normal random variable, test
the hypothesis (cid:2) (cid:2)4500 kg against the alternative (cid:2) (cid:2)4400 kg. Here (cid:2) may be a value given by the

P(Y(cid:5)c)(cid:2)a(cid:2)0.05, that is, P(Y(cid:6)c)(cid:2)0.95,
and Table A10 in App. 5 with 14 degrees of freedom we obtain c(cid:2)23.68.This is the critical value of Y. Hence
to S2(cid:2)s2Y (n(cid:3)1)(cid:2)0.714Ythere corresponds the critical value c*(cid:2)0.714(cid:5)23.68(cid:2)16.91.Since s2(cid:7)c*,

we accept the hypothesis.
If the alternative is true, the random variable Y (cid:2)14S2 s2(cid:2)0.7S2has a chi-square distribution with 14

From a more extensive table of the chi-square distribution (e.g. in Ref. [G3] or [G8]) or from your CAS, you
see that h(cid:2)62%.Hence the Type II risk is very large, namely, 38%.To make this risk smaller, we would
(cid:2)
have to increase the sample size.
Comparison of Means and Variances
EXAMPLE 5 Comparison of the Means of Two Normal Distributions
Using a sample x ,Á , x from a normal distribution with unknown mean (cid:2) and a sample y ,Á , y from
another normal di1 stribution n1 with unknown mean (cid:2) ,we want to test the hypox thesis that the m1 eans aren 2 equal,

(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) ,against an alternative, say, (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2) .The variances need not be known but are assumed to be equal.3
x y x y
Two cases of comparing means are of practical importance:
Case A. The samples have the same size.Furthermore, each value of the first sample corresponds to precisely
one value of the other,because corresponding values result from the same person or thing (paired comparison)—
for example, two measurements of the same thing by two different methods or two measurements from the two
eyes of the same person. More generally, they may result from pairs of similarindividuals or things, for example,
identical twins, pairs of used front tires from the same car, etc. Then we should form the differences of
corresponding values and test the hypothesis that the population corresponding to the differences has mean 0,
using the method in Example 3. If we have a choice, this method is better than the following.
3This assumption of equality of variances can be tested, as shown in the next example. If the test shows that
they differ significantly, choose two samples of the same size n (cid:2)n (cid:2)n(not too small, (cid:5)30, say), use the
1 2
test in Example 2 together with the fact that (12) is an observed value of an approximately standardized normal
random variable.

Case B. The two samples are independent and not necessarily of the same size. Then we may proceed
asfollows. Suppose that the alternative is (cid:2) (cid:5)(cid:2) .We choose a significance level a.Then we compute the
x y
sample means x and yas well as (n 1(cid:3)1)s x2 and (n 2(cid:3)1)s y2, where s x2and s y2are the sample variances. Using
Table A9 in App. 5 with n (cid:4)n (cid:3)2degrees of freedom, we now determine cfrom

It can be shown that this is an observed value of a random variable that has a t-distribution with n (cid:4)n (cid:3)2

of corresponding sample values and the method in Example 3 to test the hypothesis (cid:2)(cid:2)0, where (cid:2)is the mean

Quality Control
The ideas on testing can be adapted and extended in various ways to serve basic practical
needs in engineering and other fields. We show this in the remaining sections for some
of the most important tasks solvable by statistical methods. As a first such area of problems,
we discuss industrial quality control, a highly successful method used in various industries.
No production process is so perfect that all the products are completely alike. There is
always a small variation that is caused by a great number of small, uncontrollable factors
and must therefore be regarded as a chance variation. It is important to make sure that the
products have required values (for example, length, strength, or whatever property may
be essential in a particular case). For this purpose one makes a test of the hypothesis that
the products have the required property, say, (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) , where (cid:2) is a required value. If
0 0
this is done after an entire lot has been produced (for example, a lot of 100,000 screws),
the test will tell us how good or how bad the products are, but it it obviously too late to
alter undesirable results. It is much better to test during the production run. This is done
at regular intervals of time (for example, every hour or half-hour) and is called quality
control. Each time a sample of the same size is taken, in practice 3 to 10 times. If the
hypothesis is rejected, we stop the production and look for the cause of the trouble.
1088 CHAP. 25 Mathematical Statistics
If we stop the production process even though it is progressing properly, we make a
Type I error. If we do not stop the process even though something is not in order, we
make a Type II error (see Sec. 25.4). The result of each test is marked in graphical form
on what is called a control chart. This was proposed by W. A. Shewhart in 1924 and
makes quality control particularly effective.
Control Chart for the Mean
An illustration and example of a control chart is given in the upper part of Fig. 537. This
control chart for the mean shows the lower control limit LCL, the center control line
CL, and the upper control limit UCL. The two control limits correspond to the critical
values c and c in case (c) of Example 2 in Sec. 25.4. As soon as a sample mean falls

production process is “out of control”; that is, we assert that there has been a shift in
process level. Action is called for whenever a point exceeds the limits.
If we choose control limits that are too loose, we shall not detect process shifts. On the
other hand, if we choose control limits that are too tight, we shall be unable to run the
process because of frequent searches for nonexistent trouble. The usual significance level
is a(cid:2)1%.From Theorem 1 in Sec. 25.3 and Table A8 in App. 5 we see that in the case
of the normal distribution the corresponding control limits for the mean are

Here sis assumed to be known. If sis unknown, we may compute the standard deviations
of the first 20 or 30 samples and take their arithmetic mean as an approximation of s.
The broken line connecting the means in Fig. 537 is merely to display the results.
Additional, more subtle controls are often used in industry. For instance, one observes
the motions of the sample means above and below the centerline, which should happen
frequently. Accordingly, long runs (conventionally of length 7 or more) of means all above
(or all below) the centerline could indicate trouble.

Control Chart for the Variance
In addition to the mean, one often controls the variance, the standard deviation, or the range.
To set up a control chart for the variance in the case of a normal distribution, we may employ
the method in Example 4 of Sec. 25.4 for determining control limits. It is customary to use only
one control limit, namely, an upper control limit. Now from Example 4 of Sec. 25.4 we have
S2(cid:2)s2Y (n(cid:3)1),where, because of our normality assumption, the random variable Yhas a

and the table of the chi-square distribution (Table A10 in App. 5) with n(cid:3)1 degrees of
freedom (or from your CAS); here a (5% or 1%, say)is the probability that in a properly
running process an observed value s2 of S2 is greater than the upper control limit.

A control chart for the standard deviation with both an upper and a lower control limit
is obtained from (3).
Control Chart for the Range
Instead of the variance or standard deviation, one often controls the range R ((cid:2) largest
sample value minus smallest sample value). It can be shown that in the case of the normal
distribution, the standard deviation s is proportional to the expectation of the random

Since R depends on two sample values only, it gives less information about a sample
than sdoes. Clearly, the larger the sample size nis, the more information we lose in using
R instead of s. A practical rule is to use s when n is larger than 10.

Acceptance Sampling
Acceptance samplingis usually done when products leave the factory (or in some cases
even within the factory). The standard situation in acceptance sampling is that a producer
supplies to a consumer (a buyer or wholesaler) a lot of N items (a carton of screws, for
instance). The decision to accept or reject the lot is made by determining the number x
of defectives ((cid:2)defective items) in a sample of size n from the lot. The lot is accepted
if x(cid:6)c, where c is called the acceptance number, giving the allowable number of
defectives. If x(cid:5)c, the consumer rejects the lot. Clearly, producer and consumer must
agree on a certain sampling plan giving n and c.
From the hypergeometric distribution we see that the event A: “Accept the lot” has
probability (see Sec. 24.7)

Goodness of Fit. -Test
To test for goodness of fit means that we wish to test that a certain function F(x) is the
Á
distribution function of a distribution from which we have a sample x , , x .Then we
(cid:2) 1 n
test whether the sample distribution function F(x) defined by
(cid:2)
F(x)(cid:2)Sum of the relative frequencies of all sample values x not exceeding x
j
fits F(x) “sufficiently well.” If this is so, we shall accept the hypothesis that F(x) is the
distribution function of the population; if not, we shall reject the hypothesis.
This test is of considerable practical importance, and it differs in character from the
tests for parameters ((cid:2), s2, etc.) considered so far.
(cid:2)
To test in that fashion, we have to know how much F(x) can differ from F(x) if the
hypothesis is true. Hence we must first introduce a quantity that measures the deviation
(cid:2)
of F(x) from F(x), and we must know the probability distribution of this quantity under
the assumption that the hypothesis is true. Then we proceed as follows. We determine
a number c such that, if the hypothesis is true, a deviation greater than c has a small
preassigned probability. If, nevertheless, a deviation greater than coccurs, we have reason
to doubt that the hypothesis is true and we reject it. On the other hand, if the deviation
(cid:2)
does not exceed c, so that F(x) approximates F(x) sufficiently well, we accept the
hypothesis. Of course, if we accept the hypothesis, this means that we have insufficient
evidence to reject it, and this does not exclude the possibility that there are other functions
that would not be rejected in the test. In this respect the situation is quite similar to that
in Sec. 25.4.
Table 25.7 shows a test of that type, which was introduced by R. A. Fisher. This
test is justified by the fact that if the hypothesis is true, then (cid:20)2 is an observed value
0
of a random variable whose distribution function approaches that of the chi-square
distribution with K(cid:3)1 degrees of freedom (or K(cid:3)r(cid:3)1 degrees of freedom if r
parameters are estimated) as n approaches infinity. The requirement that at least five
sample values lie in each interval in Table 25.7 results from the fact that for finite
n that random variable has only approximately a chi-square distribution. A proof can
be found in Ref. [G3] listed in App. 1. If the sample is so small that the requirement
cannot be satisfied, one may continue with the test, but then use the result with
caution.

Nonparametric Tests
Nonparametric tests, also called distribution-free tests, are valid for any distribution.
Hence they are used in cases when the kind of distribution is unknown, or is known but
such that no tests specifically designed for it are available. In this section we shall explain
the basic idea of these tests, which are based on “order statistics” and are rather simple.
If there is a choice, then tests designed for a specific distribution generally give better
results than do nonparametric tests. For instance, this applies to the tests in Sec. 25.4 for
the normal distribution.
We shall discuss two tests in terms of typical examples. In deriving the distributions
used in the test, it is essential that the distributions, from which we sample, are continuous.
(Nonparametric tests can also be derived for discrete distributions, but this is slightly more
complicated.)
EXAMPLE 1 Sign Test for the Median
A medianof the population is a solution x(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2) of the equation F(x)(cid:2)0.5,where Fis the distribution function
of the population.
Suppose that eight radio operators were tested, first in rooms without air-conditioning and then in air-conditioned
rooms over the same period of time, and the difference of errors (unconditioned minus conditioned) were

Test the hypothesis (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)0(that is, air-conditioning has no effect) against the alternative (cid:2)(cid:5)0(that is, inferior
performance in unconditioned rooms).
Solution. We choose the significance level a(cid:2)5%.If the hypothesis is true, the probability pof a positive
difference is the same as that of a negative difference. Hence in this case, p(cid:2)0.5,and the random variable
X(cid:2)Number of positive values among n values
has a binomial distribution with p(cid:2)0.5. Our sample has eight values. We omit the values 0, which do not
contribute to the decision. Then six values are left, all of which are positive. Since

we have observed an event whose probability is very small if the hypothesis is true; in fact 1.56%(cid:7)a(cid:2)5%.
Hence we assert that the alternative
(cid:2)(cid:2)
(cid:5)0is true. That is, the number of errors made in unconditioned rooms
(cid:2)
is significantly higher, so that installation of air conditioning should be considered.
EXAMPLE 2 Test for Arbitrary Trend
A certain machine is used for cutting lengths of wire. Five successive pieces had the lengths
29 31 28 30 32.
Using this sample, test the hypothesis that there is no trend, that is, the machine does not have the tendency to
produce longer and longer pieces or shorter and shorter pieces. Assume that the type of machine suggests the
alternative that there is positive trend,that is, there is the tendency of successive pieces to get longer.
Solution. We count the number of transpositionsin the sample, that is, the number of times a larger value
precedes a smaller value:
29 precedes 28 (1 transposition),
31 precedes 28 and 30 (2 transpositions).
The remaining three sample values follow in ascending order. Hence in the sample there are 1(cid:4)2(cid:2)3
transpositions. We now consider the random variable
T(cid:2)Number of transpositions.
If the hypothesis is true (no trend), then each of the 5!(cid:2)120permutations of five elements 1 2 3 4 5 has the
same probability (1 120).We arrange these permutations according to their number of transpositions:

We accept the hypothesis because we have observed an event that has a relatively large probability (certainly
much more than 5%)if the hypothesis is true.
Values of the distribution function of Tin the case of no trend are shown in Table A12, App. 5. For instance,
if n(cid:2)3, then F(0)(cid:2)0.167, F(1)(cid:2)0.500, F(2)(cid:2)1(cid:3)0.167. If n(cid:2)4, then F(0)(cid:2)0.042, F(1)(cid:2)0.167,
F(2)(cid:2)0.375, F(3)(cid:2)1(cid:3)0.375, F(4)(cid:2)1(cid:3)0.167,and so on.

Regression. Fitting Straight Lines.
Correlation
So far we were concerned with random experiments in which we observed a single quantity
(random variable) and got samples whose values were single numbers. In this section we
discuss experiments in which we observe or measure two quantities simultaneously, so
Á
that we get samples of pairs of values (x , y ), (x , y ), , (x , y ). Most applications
1 1 2 2 n n
involve one of two kinds of experiments, as follows.
1. In regression analysis one of the two variables, call it x, can be regarded as an
ordinary variable because we can measure it without substantial error or we can
even give it values we want. x is called the independent variable, or sometimes
the controlled variablebecause we can control it (set it at values we choose). The
other variable, Y, is a random variable, and we are interested in the dependence of
Y on x. Typical examples are the dependence of the blood pressure Y on the age x
of a person or, as we shall now say, the regression of Y on x, the regression of the
gain of weight Y of certain animals on the daily ration of food x, the regression of
the heat conductivity Y of cork on the specific weight x of the cork, etc.
2. In correlation analysis both quantities are random variables and we are interested
in relations between them. Examples are the relation (one says “correlation”)
between wear X and wear Y of the front tires of cars, between grades X and Y of
students in mathematics and in physics, respectively, between the hardness X of
steel plates in the center and the hardness Y near the edges of the plates, etc.
Regression Analysis
In regression analysis the dependence of Y on x is a dependence of the mean (cid:2) of Y on
x, so that (cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:2)(x) is a function in the ordinary sense. The curve of (cid:2)(x) is called the
regression curve of Y on x.
In this section we discuss the simplest case, namely, that of a straight regression line
(1) (cid:2)(x)(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:4)(cid:4) x.
0 1
Then we may want to graph the sample values as n points in the xY-plane, fit a straight
line through them, and use it for estimating (cid:2)(x)at values of xthat interest us, so that we
know what values of Y we can expect for those x. Fitting that line by eye would not be
good because it would be subjective; that is, different persons’ results would come out
differently, particularly if the points are scattered. So we need a mathematical method that
gives a unique result depending only on the npoints. A widely used procedure is the method
of least squares by Gauss and Legendre. For our task we may formulate it as follows.
Least Squares Principle
The straight line should be fitted through the given points so that the sum of the
squares of the distances of those points from the straight line is minimum, where
the distance is measured in the vertical direction (the y-direction). (Formulas below.)
c25.qxd 11/3/10 6:21 PM Page 1104
1104 CHAP. 25 Mathematical Statistics
To get uniqueness of the straight line, we need some extra condition. To see this, take
the sample (0, 1), (0, (cid:3)1). Then all the lines y(cid:2)k x with any k satisfy the principle.
1 1
(Can you see it?) The following assumption will imply uniqueness, as we shall find out.
General Assumption (A1)

The x-values x , , x in our sample (x , y ), , (x , y ) are not all equal.

From a given sample (x , y ), , (x , y ) we shall now determine a straight line by
1 1 n n
least squares. We write the line as
(2) y(cid:2)k (cid:4)k x
0 1
and call it the sample regression linebecause it will be the counterpart of the population
regression line (1).
Now a sample point (x , y) has the vertical distance (distance measured in the
j j
y-direction) from (2) given by
ƒy (cid:3)(k (cid:4)k x )ƒ (see Fig. 543).

Confidence Intervals in Regression Analysis
If we want to get confidence intervals, we have to make assumptions about the distribution
of Y (which we have not made so far; least squares is a “geometric principle,” nowhere
involving probabilities!). We assume normality and independence in sampling:
Assumption (A2)
For each fixed x the random variable Y is normal with mean (1), that is,
(12) (cid:2)(x)(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:4)(cid:4) x
0 1
and variance s2 independent of x.
Assumption (A3)
The n performances of the experiment by which we obtain a sample
(x , y ), (x , y ),
Á
, (x , y )
1 1 2 2 n n
are independent.
(cid:4) in (12) is called the regression coefficientof the population because it can be shown
1
that, under Assumptions (A1)–(A3), the maximum likelihood estimate of (cid:4) is the sample
1
regression coefficient k given by (11).
1
Under Assumptions (A1)–(A3), we may now obtain a confidence interval for (cid:4) , as
1
shown in Table 25.12.

Correlation Analysis
We shall now give an introduction to the basic facts in correlation analysis; for proofs see
Ref. [G2] or [G8] in App. 1.
Correlation analysis is concerned with the relation between X and Y in a two-
dimensional random variable (X, Y) (Sec. 24.9). A sample consists of n ordered pairs of
Á
values (x , y ), , (x , y ),as before. The interrelation between the xand yvalues in the
1 1 n n
sample is measured by the sample covariance s in (8) or by the sample correlation
xy
coefficient
s
xy
(17) r(cid:2)
s s
x y
with s and s given in (9). Here r has the advantage that it does not change under a
x y
multiplication of the x and y values by a factor (in going from feet to inches, etc.).
THEOREM 1 Sample Correlation Coefficient
The sample correlation coefficient r satisfies (cid:3)1(cid:6)r(cid:6)1. In particular, r(cid:2)(cid:12) 1
if and only if the sample values lie on a straight line. (See Fig. 544.)
The theoretical counterpart of r is the correlation coefficient r of X and Y,

The analog of Theorem 1 is
THEOREM 2 Correlation Coefficient
The correlation coefficient r satisfies (cid:3)1(cid:6)r(cid:6)1. In particular, r(cid:2)(cid:12)1 if and
only if X and Y are linearly related, that is, Y(cid:2)gX(cid:4)d, X(cid:2)g*Y(cid:4)d*.
X and Y are called uncorrelated if r(cid:2)0.
THEOREM 3 Independence. Normal Distribution
(a) Independent X and Y (see Sec. 24.9) are uncorrelated.
(b) If (X, Y) is normal (see below), then uncorrelated X and Y are
independent.
Here the two-dimensional normal distribution can be introduced by taking two independent
standardized normal random variables X*, Y*,whose joint distribution thus has the density

so that r(cid:2)0and Xand Yare uncorrelated. But they are certainly not independent since they are even functionally

SUMMARY OF CHAPTER
Mathematical Statistics
We recall from Chap. 24 that, with an experiment in which we observe some quantity
(number of defectives, height of persons, etc.), there is associated a random variable
X whose probability distribution is given by a distribution function
(1) F(x)(cid:2)P(X(cid:6)x) (Sec. 24.5)
which for each x gives the probability that X assumes any value not exceeding x.
Á
In statistics we take random samples x , , x of size n by performing that
1 n
experiment n times (Sec. 25.1) and draw conclusions from properties of samples
about properties of the distribution of the corresponding X. We do this by calculating
point estimates or confidence intervals or by performing a test for parameters ((cid:2)
and s2 in the normal distribution, p in the binomial distribution, etc.) or by a test
for distribution functions.

Summary of Chapter 25 1113
A point estimate (Sec. 25.2) is an approximate value for a parameter in the
distribution of X obtained from a sample. Notably, the sample mean (Sec. 25.1)

[(x 1(cid:3)x)2(cid:4) Á (cid:4)(x n(cid:3)x)2]
j(cid:2)1
is an estimate of the variance s2 of X. Point estimation can be done by the basic
maximum likelihood method (Sec. 25.2).
Confidence intervals (Sec. 25.3) are intervals u (cid:6)u(cid:6)u with endpoints
1 2
calculated from a sample such that, with a high probability g, we obtain an interval
that contains the unknown true value of the parameter u in the distribution of X.
Here, gis chosen at the beginning, usually 95% or 99%.We denote such an interval
by CONF {u (cid:6)u(cid:6)u }.
g 1 2
In a testfor a parameter we test a hypothesisu(cid:2)u against an alternative u(cid:2)u
0 1
and then, on the basis of a sample, accept the hypothesis, or we reject it in favor of
the alternative (Sec. 25.4). Like any conclusion about X from samples, this may
involve errors leading to a false decision. There is a small probability a(which we
can choose, 5% or 1%,for instance) that we reject a true hypothesis, and there is a
probability b (which we can compute and decrease by taking larger samples) that
we accept a false hypothesis. ais called the significance leveland 1(cid:3)bthe power
of the test. Among many other engineering applications, testing is used in quality
control (Sec. 25.5) and acceptance sampling (Sec. 25.6).
If not merely a parameter but the kind of distribution of X is unknown, we can
use the chi-square test (Sec. 25.7) for testing the hypothesis that some function
F(x) is the unknown distribution function of X. This is done by determining the
(cid:2)
discrepancy between F(x) and the distribution function F(x) of a given sample.
“Distribution-free” or nonparametric testsare tests that apply to any distribution,
since they are based on combinatorial ideas. These tests are usually very simple.
Two of them are discussed in Sec. 25.8.
The last section deals with samples of pairs of values, which arise in an experiment
when we simultaneously observe two quantities. In regression analysis, one of the
quantities, x, is an ordinary variable and the other, Y, is a random variable whose
mean (cid:2) depends on x, say, (cid:2)(x)(cid:2)(cid:4) (cid:4)(cid:4) x. In correlation analysis the relation
0 1
between X and Y in a two-dimensional random variable (X, Y) is investigated,
notably in terms of the correlation coefficient r.

Gamma function (Fig. 553 and Table A2 in App. 5). The gamma function (cid:12)((cid:13)) is defined
by the integral
(cid:4)(cid:14)
(24) (cid:12)((cid:13)) (cid:2) e(cid:2)tt(cid:13)(cid:2)1 dt ((cid:13)(cid:15) 0),
0
which is meaningful only if (cid:13)(cid:15)0 (or, if we consider complex (cid:13), for those (cid:13)whose real
part is positive). Integration by parts gives the important functional relation of the gamma
function,
(25) (cid:12)((cid:13)(cid:3) 1) (cid:2) (cid:13)(cid:12)((cid:13)).
From (24) we readily have (cid:12)(1) (cid:2) 1; hence if (cid:13)is a positive integer, say k, then by
repeated application of (25) we obtain
(26) (cid:12)(k (cid:3) 1) (cid:2) k! (k (cid:2) 0, 1, •••).
This shows that the gamma function can be regarded as a generalization of the elementary
factorial function.[Sometimes the notation ((cid:13)(cid:4)1)! is used for (cid:12)((cid:13)), even for noninteger
values of (cid:13), and the gamma function is also known as the factorial function.]
By repeated application of (25) we obtain
(cid:12)((cid:13)(cid:3) 1) (cid:12)((cid:13)(cid:3) 2) (cid:12)((cid:13)(cid:3) k (cid:3) 1)

for defining the gamma function for negative (cid:13)((cid:16) (cid:4)1, (cid:4)2, •••), choosing for k the
smallest integer such that (cid:13)(cid:3)k(cid:3)1 (cid:15)0. Together with(24), this then gives a definition
of (cid:12)((cid:13)) for all (cid:13)not equal to zero or a negative integer (Fig. 553).
It can be shown that the gamma function may also be represented as the limit of a
product, namely, by the formula
n! n(cid:13)
(28) (cid:12)((cid:13)) (cid:2) lim (cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6) ((cid:13)(cid:16) 0, (cid:4)1, •••).
n*(cid:14) (cid:13)((cid:13)(cid:3) 1)((cid:13)(cid:3) 2) ••• ((cid:13)(cid:3) n)
From (27) or (28) we see that, for complex (cid:13), the gamma function (cid:12)((cid:13)) is a meromorphic
function with simple poles at (cid:13)(cid:2) 0, (cid:4)1, (cid:4)2, •••.
An approximation of the gamma function for large positive (cid:13)is given by the Stirling
formula
(cid:13) (cid:13)

Partial Derivatives
For differentiation formulas, see inside of front cover.
Let z (cid:2) ƒ(x, y) be a real function of two independent real variables, x and y. If we keep
y constant, say, y (cid:2) y , and think of x as a variable, then ƒ(x, y ) depends on x alone. If
1 1
the derivative of ƒ(x, y ) with respect to xfor a value x(cid:2)x exists, then the value of this
1 1
derivative is called the partial derivativeof ƒ(x, y) with respect to x at the point(x , y )
1 1
and is denoted by
(cid:17)ƒ (cid:17)z
(cid:6) j or by (cid:6)j .
(cid:17)x (cid:17)x
(x1,y1) (x1,y1)
Other notations are
ƒ (x , y ) and z (x , y );
x 1 1 x 1 1
these may be used when subscripts are not used for another purpose and there is no danger
of confusion.
bapp03.qxd 11/5/10 12:09 AM Page A70

We thus have, by the definition of the derivative,
(cid:4)ƒ ƒ(x (cid:5) (cid:3)x, y ) (cid:8) ƒ(x , y )
(1) (cid:7) j (cid:2) lim (cid:7)1 (cid:7)1 (cid:7)1 1 .
(cid:4)x (cid:3)x
(cid:3)x*0
(x1,y1)
The partial derivative of z(cid:2)ƒ(x, y) with respect to yis defined similarly; we now keep
x constant, say, equal to x , and differentiate ƒ(x , y) with respect to y. Thus
1 1
(cid:4)ƒ (cid:4)z ƒ(x , y (cid:5) (cid:3)y) (cid:8) ƒ(x , y )
(2) (cid:7) j (cid:2) (cid:7) j (cid:2) lim (cid:7)1 1 (cid:7)(cid:7)1 1 .
(cid:4)y (cid:4)y (cid:3)y
(cid:3)y*0
(x1,y1) (x1,y1)
Other notations are ƒ (x , y ) and z (x , y ).
y 1 1 y 1 1
It is clear that the values of those two partial derivatives will in general depend on the
point (x , y ). Hence the partial derivatives (cid:4)z/(cid:4)x and (cid:4)z/(cid:4)y at a variable point (x, y) are
1 1
functions of x and y. The function (cid:4)z/(cid:4)x is obtained as in ordinary calculus by
differentiating z(cid:2)ƒ(x, y) with respect to x, treating y as a constant, and (cid:4)z/(cid:4)yis obtained
by differentiating z with respect to y, treating x as a constant.

The partial derivatives (cid:4)z/(cid:4)x and (cid:4)z/(cid:4)y of a function z (cid:2) ƒ(x, y) have a very simple
geometric interpretation. The function z (cid:2) ƒ(x, y) can be represented by a surface in
space. The equation y (cid:2) y then represents a vertical plane intersecting the surface in a
1
curve, and the partial derivative (cid:4)z/(cid:4)x at a point (x , y ) is the slope of the tangent (that
1 1
is, tan(cid:6)where (cid:6)is the angle shown in Fig. 557) to the curve. Similarly, the partial
derivative (cid:4)z/(cid:4)y at (x , y ) is the slope of the tangent to the curve x (cid:2) x on the surface
1 1 1
z (cid:2) ƒ(x, y) at (x , y ).

The partial derivatives (cid:17)z/(cid:17)x and (cid:17)z/(cid:17)y are called first partial derivatives or partial

It can be shown that if all the derivatives concerned are continuous, then the two mixed
partial derivatives are equal, so that the order of differentiation does not matter (see Ref.
[GenRef4] in App. 1), that is,

By differentiating the second partial derivatives again with respect to x and y,
respectively, we obtain the third partial derivatives or partial derivatives of the third
order of ƒ, etc.
If we consider a function ƒ(x, y, z) of three independent variables, then we have the
three first partial derivatives ƒ (x, y, z), ƒ (x, y, z), and ƒ (x, y, z). Here ƒ is obtained by
x y z x
differentiating ƒ with respect to x, treating both y and z as constants. Thus, analogous to
(1), we now have
(cid:17)ƒ ƒ(x (cid:3) (cid:18)x, y , z ) (cid:4) ƒ(x , y , z )

Sequences and Series
See also Chap. 15.
Monotone Real Sequences
We call a real sequence x , x , •••, x , •••a monotone sequenceif it is either monotone
1 2 n
increasing, that is,
x (cid:19) x (cid:19) x (cid:19) •••
1 2 3
or monotone decreasing, that is,
x (cid:20) x (cid:20) x (cid:20) •••.
1 2 3
We call x , x , •••a bounded sequenceif there is a positive constant Ksuch that (cid:8)x (cid:8)(cid:21)K
1 2 n
for all n.
THEOREM 1 If a real sequence is bounded and monotone, it converges.
PROOF Let x , x , ••• be a bounded monotone increasing sequence. Then its terms are smaller
1 2
than some number B and, since x (cid:19) x for all n, they lie in the interval x (cid:19) x (cid:19) B,
1 n 1 n
which will be denoted by I . We bisect I ; that is, we subdivide it into two parts of equal
0 0
length. If the right half (together with its endpoints) contains terms of the sequence, we
denote it by I . If it does not contain terms of the sequence, then the left half of I (together
1 0
with its endpoints) is called I . This is the first step.
1
In the second step we bisect I , select one half by the same rule, and call it I , and so
1 2
on (see Fig. 558).
In this way we obtain shorter and shorter intervals I , I , I , ••• with the following
0 1 2
properties. Each I contains all I for n (cid:15) m. No term of the sequence lies to the right
m n
of I , and, since the sequence is monotone increasing, all x with n greater than some
m n
number N lie in I ; of course, N will depend on m, in general. The lengths of the I
m m
approach zero as m approaches infinity. Hence there is precisely one number, call it L,
that lies in all those intervals,3 and we may now easily prove that the sequence is
convergent with the limit L.
In fact, given an (cid:22)(cid:15)0, we choose an msuch that the length of I is less than (cid:22). Then
m
L and all the x with n (cid:15) N(m) lie in I , and, therefore, (cid:8)x (cid:4) L(cid:8) (cid:21) (cid:22)for all those n.
n m n
This completes the proof for an increasing sequence. For a decreasing sequence the proof
is the same, except for a suitable interchange of “left” and “right” in the construction of
those intervals. (cid:2)
3This statement seems to be obvious, but actually it is not; it may be regarded as an axiom of the real number
system in the following form. Let J , J , •••be closed intervals such that each J contains all J with n(cid:15)m,
1 2 m n
and the lengths of the J approach zero as mapproaches infinity. Then there is precisely one real number that
m
is contained in all those intervals. This is the so-called Cantor–Dedekind axiom, named after the German
mathematicians GEORG CANTOR (1845–1918), the creator of set theory, and RICHARD DEDEKIND
(1831–1916), known for his fundamental work in number theory. For further details see Ref. [GenRef2] in App. 1.
(An interval Iis said to be closedif its two endpoints are regarded as points belonging to I. It is said to be open
if the endpoints are not regarded as points of I.)

so that s (cid:19) s (cid:19) s . Proceeding in this fashion, we conclude that (Fig. 559)

Now, since s (cid:4) s (cid:2) x , we readily see that (lb) implies

Hence s* (cid:2) s, and the series converges with the sum s.
We prove the estimate (2) for the remainder. Since s * s, it follows from (3) that
n
s (cid:20) s (cid:20) s and also s (cid:20) s (cid:20) s .
2n(cid:3)1 2n 2n(cid:2)1 2n
By subtracting s and s , respectively, we obtain

2n(cid:3)1 2n 2n 2n(cid:2)1 2n 2n(cid:2)1
In these inequalities, the first expression is equal to x , the last is equal to (cid:4)x , and
2n(cid:3)1 2n
the expressions between the inequality signs are the remainders R and R . Thus the
2n 2n(cid:2)1

and we see that they imply (2). This completes the proof. (cid:2)

To simplify formulas, we write Cartesian coordinates x(cid:2)x , y(cid:2)x , z(cid:2)x . We denote
1 2 3
curvilinear coordinates by q , q , q . Through each point P there pass three coordinate
1 2 3
surfaces q (cid:2)const, q (cid:2)const, q (cid:2)const. They intersect along coordinate curves. We
1 2 3
assume the three coordinate curves through P to be orthogonal (perpendicular to each
other). We write coordinate transformations as
(1) x (cid:2) x (q , q , q ), x (cid:2) x (q , q , q ), x (cid:2) x (q , q , q ).
1 1 1 2 3 2 2 1 2 3 3 3 1 2 3

PROOF OF THEOREM 1 Uniqueness1
Assuming that the problem consisting of the ODE
(1) y(cid:2) (cid:3) p(x)y(cid:4) (cid:3) q(x)y (cid:5) 0
and the two initial conditions
(2) y(x ) (cid:5) K , y(cid:4) (x ) (cid:5) K
0 0 0 1
has two solutions y (x) and y (x) on the interval I in the theorem, we show that their
1 2
difference
y(x) (cid:5) y (x) (cid:6) y (x)
1 2
is identically zero on I; then y (cid:2) y on I, which implies uniqueness.
1 2
Since (1) is homogeneous and linear, yis a solution of that ODE on I, and since y and
1
y satisfy the same initial conditions, y satisfies the conditions
2
(11) y(x ) (cid:5) 0, y(cid:4) (x ) (cid:5) 0.
0 0
We consider the function
z(x) (cid:5) y(x)2 (cid:3) y(cid:4) (x)2
and its derivative
z(cid:4) (cid:5) 2yy(cid:4) (cid:3) 2y(cid:4) y(cid:2) .
From the ODE we have
y(cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:6)py(cid:4) (cid:6) qy.
(cid:4)
By substituting this in the expression for z we obtain
(12) z(cid:4) (cid:5) 2yy(cid:4) (cid:6) 2py(cid:4) 2 (cid:6) 2qyy(cid:4) .
(cid:4)
Now, since y and y are real,
(y (cid:7) y(cid:4) )2 (cid:5) y2 (cid:7) 2yy(cid:4) (cid:3) y(cid:4) 2 (cid:8) 0.
1This proof was suggested by my colleague, Prof. A. D. Ziebur. In this proof, we use some formula numbers
that have not yet been used in Sec. 2.6.

bapp04a.qxd 11/3/10 8:35 PM Page A78

From this and the definition of z we obtain the two inequalities
(13) (a) 2yy(cid:4) (cid:9) y2 (cid:3) y(cid:4) 2 (cid:5) z, (b) (cid:6)2yy(cid:4) (cid:9) y2 (cid:3) y(cid:4) 2 (cid:5) z.
From (13b) we have 2yy(cid:4) (cid:8) (cid:6)z. Together, (cid:3)2yy(cid:4)(cid:3) (cid:9) z. For the last term in (12) we now
obtain
(cid:6)2qyy(cid:4) (cid:9) (cid:3)(cid:6)2qyy(cid:4)(cid:3) (cid:5) (cid:3)q(cid:3)(cid:3)2yy(cid:4)(cid:3) (cid:9) (cid:3)q(cid:3)z.
Using this result as well as (cid:6)p(cid:9)(cid:3)p(cid:3)and applying (13a) to the term 2yy(cid:4) in (12), we find
z(cid:4) (cid:9) z (cid:3) 2(cid:3)p(cid:3)y(cid:4) 2 (cid:3) (cid:3)q(cid:3)z.
Since y(cid:4) 2 (cid:9) y2 (cid:3) y(cid:4) 2 (cid:5) z, from this we obtain
z(cid:4) (cid:9) (1 (cid:3) 2(cid:3)p(cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:3)q(cid:3))z
or, denoting the function in parentheses by h,
(14a) z(cid:4) (cid:9) hz for all x on I.
Similarly, from (12) and (13) it follows that
(cid:6)z(cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6)2yy(cid:4) (cid:3) 2py(cid:4) 2 (cid:3) 2qyy(cid:4)
(14b)
(cid:9) z (cid:3) 2(cid:3)p(cid:3)z (cid:3) (cid:3)q(cid:3)z (cid:5) hz.
The inequalities (14a) and (14b) are equivalent to the inequalities
(15) z(cid:4) (cid:6) hz (cid:9) 0, z(cid:4) (cid:3) hz (cid:8) 0.
Integrating factors for the two expressions on the left are
F (cid:5) e(cid:2)(cid:4)h(x)dx and F (cid:5) e(cid:4)h(x)dx.
1 2
The integrals in the exponents exist because his continuous. Since F and F are positive,
1 2
we thus have from (15)
F (z(cid:4) (cid:6) hz) (cid:5) (F z)(cid:4) (cid:9) 0 and F (z(cid:4) (cid:3) hz) (cid:5) (F z)(cid:4) (cid:8) 0.
1 1 2 2
This means that F z is nonincreasing and F z is nondecreasing on I. Since z(x ) (cid:5) 0 by
1 2 0
(11), when x (cid:9) x we thus obtain
0
F z (cid:8) (F z) (cid:5) 0, F z (cid:9) (F z) (cid:5) 0
1 1 x0 2 2 x0
and similarly, when x (cid:8) x ,
0
F z (cid:9) 0, F z (cid:8) 0.
1 2
Dividing by F and F and noting that these functions are positive, we altogether have
1 2
z (cid:9) 0, z (cid:8) 0 for all x on I.
This implies that z (cid:5) y2 (cid:3) y(cid:4) 2 (cid:2) 0 on I. Hence y (cid:2) 0 or y (cid:2) y on I. (cid:2)

PROOF OF THEOREM 2 Frobenius Method. Basis of Solutions. Three Cases
The formula numbers in this proof are the same as in the text of Sec. 5.3. An additional
formula not appearing in Sec. 5.3 will be called (A) (see below).
The ODE in Theorem 2 is
b(x) c(x)
(1) y(cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:11) y(cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:11) y (cid:5) 0,
x x2
where b(x) and c(x) are analytic functions. We can write it
(1(cid:4) ) x2y(cid:2) (cid:3) xb(x)y(cid:4) (cid:3) c(x)y (cid:5) 0.
The indicial equation of (1) is
(4) r(r (cid:6) 1) (cid:3) b r (cid:3) c (cid:5) 0.
0 0
The roots r , r of this quadratic equation determine the general form of a basis of solutions
1 2
of (1), and there are three possible cases as follows.
Case 1. Distinct Roots Not Differing by an Integer. A first solution of (1) is of the form
(5) y 1(x) (cid:5) xr 1(a
0
(cid:3) a 1x (cid:3) a 2x2 (cid:3) •••)
and can be determined as in the power series method. For a proof that in this case, the
ODE (1) has a second independent solution of the form
(6) y 2(x) (cid:5) xr 2(A
0
(cid:3) A 1x (cid:3) A 2x2 (cid:3) •••),
see Ref. [A11] listed in App. 1.
Case 2. Double Root. The indicial equation (4) has a double root r if and only if
(b (cid:6) 1)2 (cid:6) 4c (cid:5) 0, and then r (cid:5) _ 1(1 (cid:6) b ). A first solution

can be determined as in Case 1. We show that a second independent solution is of the
form
(8) y (x) (cid:5) y (x) lnx (cid:3) xr(A x (cid:3) A x2 (cid:3) •••) (x (cid:10) 0).
2 1 1 2
We use the method of reduction of order (see Sec. 2.1), that is, we determine u(x) such
that y (x) (cid:5) u(x)y (x) is a solution of (1). By inserting this and the derivatives
2 1
y(cid:4)(cid:5) u(cid:4) y (cid:3) uy(cid:4) , y(cid:2)(cid:5) u(cid:2) y (cid:3) 2u(cid:4) y(cid:4)(cid:3) uy(cid:2)

x2(u(cid:2) y (cid:3) 2u(cid:4) y(cid:4)(cid:3) uy(cid:2) ) (cid:3) xb(u(cid:4) y (cid:3) uy(cid:4) ) (cid:3) cuy (cid:5) 0.

Since y is a solution of (1 ), the sum of the terms involving u is zero, and this equation

reduces to

Here, and in the following, the dots designate terms that are constant or involve positive
powers of x. Now, from (7), it follows that

(A) u(cid:2) (cid:3) ((cid:11)2r (cid:3) b 0 (cid:3) •••) u(cid:4) (cid:5) 0.
x
Since r (cid:5) (1 (cid:6) b )/2, the term (2r (cid:3) b )/x equals 1/x, and by dividing by u(cid:4) we thus
0 0
have
(cid:2)
u 1

u(cid:4) x
By integration we obtain lnu(cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6)lnx (cid:3) •••, hence u(cid:4) (cid:5) (1/x)e(•••). Expanding the
exponential function in powers of xand integrating once more, we see that uis of the form
u (cid:5) lnx (cid:3) k x (cid:3) k x2 (cid:3) •••.

Inserting this into y (cid:5) uy , we obtain for y a representation of the form (8).

Case 3. Roots Differing by an Integer. We write r (cid:5) r and r (cid:5) r (cid:6) p where p is a

positive integer. A first solution

(cid:3) a 1x (cid:3) a 2x2 (cid:3) •••)
can be determined as in Cases 1 and 2. We show that a second independent solution is

0
(cid:3) A 1x (cid:3) A 2x2 (cid:3) •••)
where we may have k (cid:12) 0 or k (cid:5) 0. As in Case 2 we set y (cid:5) uy . The first steps are
2 1
literally as in Case 2 and give Eq. (A),
u(cid:2) (cid:3) ((cid:11)2r (cid:3) b 0 (cid:3) •••) u(cid:4) (cid:5) 0.

The further steps are as in Case 2. Integrating, we find
lnu(cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6)(p (cid:3) 1) lnx (cid:3) •••, thus u(cid:4) (cid:5) x(cid:2)(p(cid:3)1)e(•••)
where dots stand for some series of nonnegative integer powers of x. By expanding the
exponential function as before we obtain a series of the form

We integrate once more. Writing the resulting logarithmic term first, we get

PROOF In this proof we shall use formula numbers not yet used in Sec. 7.7.
We shall prove first that the same value is obtained no matter which row is chosen.
The proof is by induction. The statement is true for a second-order determinant, for
which the developments by the first row a a (cid:2) a ((cid:3)a ) and by the second row
11 22 12 21
a ((cid:3)a ) (cid:2) a a give the same value a a (cid:3) a a . Assuming the statement to be
21 12 22 11 11 22 12 21
true for an (n(cid:3)1)st-order determinant, we prove that it is true for an nth-order determinant.
For this purpose we expand D in terms of each of two arbitrary rows, say, the ith and
the jth, and compare the results. Without loss of generality let us assume i (cid:4) j.
First Expansion. We expand D by the ith row. A typical term in this expansion is
(19) a C (cid:5) a (cid:2)((cid:3)1)i(cid:2)kM .
ik ik ik ik
The minor M of a in Dis an (n(cid:3)1)st-order determinant. By the induction hypothesis
ik ik
we may expand it by any row. We expand it by the row corresponding to the jth row of
D. This row contains the entries a (l (cid:6) k). It is the (j (cid:3) 1)st row of M , because M
jl ik ik
does not contain entries of the ith row of D, and i (cid:4) j. We have to distinguish between
two cases as follows.
Case I. If l(cid:4)k, then the entry a belongs to the lth column of M (see Fig. 561). Hence
jl ik
the term involving a in this expansion is
jl
(20) a (cid:2)(cofactor of a in M ) (cid:5) a (cid:2)((cid:3)1)(j(cid:2)1)(cid:2)lM
jl jl ik jl ikjl
where M is the minor of a in M . Since this minor is obtained from M by deleting
ikjl jl ik ik
the row and column of a , it is obtained from D by deleting the ith and jth rows and the
jl
kth and lth columns of D. We insert the expansions of the M into that of D. Then it follows
ik
from (19) and (20) that the terms of the resulting representation of Dare of the form
(21a) a a (cid:2)((cid:3)1)bM (l (cid:4) k)
ik jl ikjl
where
b (cid:5) i (cid:2) k (cid:2) j (cid:2) l (cid:3) 1.
Case II. If l (cid:7) k, the only difference is that then a belongs to the (l (cid:3) 1)st column of
jl
M , because M does not contain entries of the kth column of D, and k(cid:4)l. This causes
ik ik
an additional minus sign in (20), and, instead of (21a), we therefore obtain
(21b) (cid:3)a a (cid:2)((cid:3)1)bM (l (cid:7) k)

where b is the same as before.

Second Expansion. We now expand D at first by the jth row. A typical term in this
expansion is
(22) a C (cid:5) a (cid:2)((cid:6)1)j(cid:3)lM .
jl jl jl jl
By the induction hypothesis we may expand the minor M of a in Dby its ith row, which
jl jl
corresponds to the ith row of D, since j (cid:10) i.
Case I. If k(cid:10)l, the entry a in that row belongs to the (k(cid:6)1)st column of M , because
ik jl
M does not contain entries of the lth column of D, and l (cid:13) k (see Fig. 561). Hence the
jl
term involving a in this expansion is
ik
(23) a (cid:2)(cofactor of a in M ) (cid:5) a (cid:2)((cid:6)1)i(cid:3)(k(cid:2)1)M ,
ik ik jl ik ikjl
where the minor M of a in M is obtained by deleting the ith and jth rows and the
ikjl ik jl
kth and lth columns of D[and is, therefore, identical with M in (20), so that our notation
ikjl
is consistent]. We insert the expansions of the M into that of D. It follows from (22) and
jl
(23) that this yields a representation whose terms are identical with those given by (21a)
when l (cid:13) k.
Case II. If k(cid:13)l, then a belongs to the kth column of M , we obtain an additional minus
ik jl
sign, and the result agrees with that characterized by (21b).
We have shown that the two expansions of Dconsist of the same terms, and this proves
our statement concerning rows.
The proof of the statement concerning columns is quite similar; if we expand D in
terms of two arbitrary columns, say, the kth and the lth, we find that the general term
involving a a is exactly the same as before. This proves that not only all column
jl ik
expansions of D yield the same value, but also that their common value is equal to the
common value of the row expansions of D.
This completes the proof and shows that our definition of an nth-order determinant is
unambiguous. (cid:2)

PROOF OF FORMULA (2)

1 2 3 3 2 2 3 1 1 3 3 1 2 2 1
We need only consider the case v(cid:12)0. Since vis perpendicular to both aand b, Theorem
1 in Sec. 9.2 gives a • v (cid:5) 0 and b • v (cid:5) 0; in components [see (2), Sec. 9.2],
a v (cid:3) a v (cid:3) a v (cid:5) 0

Multiplying the first equation by b , the last by a , and subtracting, we obtain

Multiplying the first equation by b , the last by a , and subtracting, we obtain
1 1
(a b (cid:6) a b )v (cid:5) (a b (cid:6) a b )v .
1 2 2 1 2 3 1 1 3 3
We can easily verify that these two equations are satisfied by
(4) v (cid:5) c(a b (cid:6) a b ), v (cid:5) c(a b (cid:6) a b ), v (cid:5) c(a b (cid:6) a b )
1 2 3 3 2 2 3 1 1 3 3 1 2 2 1
where cis a constant. The reader may verify, by inserting, that (4) also satisfies (3). Now
each of the equations in (3) represents a plane through the origin in v v v -space. The
1 2 3
vectors a and b are normal vectors of these planes (see Example 6 in Sec. 9.2). Since
v (cid:12) 0, these vectors are not parallel and the two planes do not coincide. Hence their
intersection is a straight line L through the origin. Since (4) is a solution of (3) and, for
varying c, represents a straight line, we conclude that (4) represents L, and every solution
of (3) must be of the form (4). In particular, the components of v must be of this form,
where c is to be determined. From (4) we obtain
(cid:3)v(cid:3)2 (cid:5) v2 (cid:3) v2 (cid:3) v2 (cid:5) c2[ (a b (cid:6) a b )2 (cid:3) (a b (cid:6) a b )2 (cid:3) (a b (cid:6) a b )2] .

This can be written
(cid:3)v(cid:3)2 (cid:5) c2[ (a2 (cid:3) a2 (cid:3) a2)(b2 (cid:3) b2 (cid:3) b2) (cid:6) (a b (cid:3) a b (cid:3) a b )2] ,
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 1 2 2 3 3
as can be verified by performing the indicated multiplications in both formulas and
comparing. Using (2) in Sec. 9.2, we thus have
(cid:3)v(cid:3)2 (cid:5) c2[(a • a)(b • b) (cid:6) (a • b)2].
By comparing this with formula (12) in Prob. 4 of Problem Set 9.3 we conclude that
c (cid:5) (cid:7)1.
We show that c (cid:5) (cid:3)1. This can be done as follows.
If we change the lengths and directions of a and b continuously and so that at the end
a (cid:5) i and b (cid:5) j (Fig. 188a in Sec. 9.3), then v will change its length and direction
continuously, and at the end, v(cid:5)i(cid:3)j(cid:5)k. Obviously we may effect the change so that
both a and b remain different from the zero vector and are not parallel at any instant.
Then v is never equal to the zero vector, and since the change is continuous and c can
only assume the values (cid:3)1 or (cid:6)1, it follows that at the end c must have the same value
as before. Now at the end a (cid:5) i, b (cid:5) j, v (cid:5) k and, therefore, a (cid:5) 1, b (cid:5) 1, v (cid:5) 1,
1 2 3
and the other components in (4) are zero. Hence from (4) we see that v (cid:5)c(cid:5)(cid:3)1. This
3
proves Theorem 1.
For a left-handed coordinate system, i(cid:3)j(cid:5)(cid:6)k(see Fig. 188b in Sec. 9.3), resulting
in c (cid:5) (cid:6)1. This proves the statement right after formula (2). (cid:2)

PROOF The representation of v in the two systems are

1 2 3 1 2 3
Since i* • i* (cid:2) 1, i* • j* (cid:2) 0, i* • k* (cid:2) 0, we get from (5b) simply i* • v (cid:2) v* and

1 1 2 3 1 2 3
Because of (3), this is the first formula in (1), and the other two formulas are obtained
similarly, by considering j* • v and then k* • v. Formula (2) follows by the same idea,

Theorem B follows from Theorem A by noting that the most general transformation of a
Cartesian coordinate system into another such system may be decomposed into a
transformation of the type just considered and a translation; and under a translation,
corresponding coordinates differ merely by a constant.
PROOF OF THE INVARIANCE OF THE CURL
We write again x , x , x instead of x, y, z, and similarly x*, x*, x* for other Cartesian
1 2 3 1 2 3
coordinates, assuming that both systems are right-handed. Let a , a , a denote the
1 2 3
components of curlv in the x x x -coordinates, as given by (1), Sec. 9.9, with
1 2 3
x (cid:2) x , y (cid:2) x , z (cid:2) x .
1 2 3
Similarly, let a*, a*, a*denote the components of curlvin the x*x*x*-coordinate system.
1 2 3 1 2 3
We prove that the length and direction of curlv are independent of the particular choice
of Cartesian coordinates, as asserted. We do this by showing that the components of curl
v satisfy the transformation law (2), which is characteristic of vector components. We
consider a . We use (6a), and then the chain rule for functions of several variables (Sec.

the first of the three relations (2 ). Because of independence of path we may integrate

THEOREM Reality of Eigenvalues
(cid:10)
If p, q, r, andp in the Sturm–Liouville equation(1) of Sec.11.5 are real-valued and
continuous on the interval a (cid:11) x (cid:11) b and r(x) (cid:12) 0 throughout that interval (or
r(x) (cid:13) 0 throughout that interval), then all the eigenvalues of the Sturm–Liouville
problem (1), (2), Sec.11.5, are real.
PROOF Let (cid:14)(cid:2) (cid:15)(cid:5) i(cid:16)be an eigenvalue of the problem and let
y(x) (cid:2) u(x) (cid:5) iv(x)
be a corresponding eigenfunction; here (cid:15), (cid:16), u, and v are real. Substituting this into (1),
Sec. 11.5, we have
(pu(cid:10) (cid:5) ipv(cid:10) )(cid:10) (cid:5) (q (cid:5) (cid:15)r (cid:5) i(cid:16)r)(u (cid:5) iv) (cid:2) 0.
This complex equation is equivalent to the following pair of equations for the real and
the imaginary parts:
(pu(cid:10) )(cid:10) (cid:5) (q (cid:5) (cid:15)r)u (cid:6) (cid:16)rv (cid:2) 0
(pv(cid:10) )(cid:10) (cid:5) (q (cid:5) (cid:15)r)v (cid:5) (cid:16)ru (cid:2) 0.
Multiplying the first equation by v, the second by (cid:6)u and adding, we get
(cid:6)(cid:16)(u2 (cid:5) v2)r (cid:2) u(pv(cid:10) )(cid:10) (cid:6) v(pu(cid:10) )(cid:10)
(cid:2) [(pv(cid:10) )u (cid:6) (pu(cid:10) )v](cid:10) .
The expression in brackets is continuous on a (cid:11) x (cid:11) b, for reasons similar to those in
the proof of Theorem 1, Sec. 11.5. Integrating over x from a to b, we thus obtain
(cid:3)
b b
(cid:6)(cid:16) (u2 (cid:5) v2)r dx(cid:2) [p(uv(cid:10) (cid:6) u(cid:10) v)] .
a a
Because of the boundary conditions, the right side is zero; this is as in that proof. Since
y is an eigenfunction, u2 (cid:5) v2 (cid:4) 0. Since y and r are continuous and r (cid:12) 0 (or r (cid:13) 0)

PROOF OF THEOREM 2 Cauchy–Riemann Equations
We prove that Cauchy–Riemann equations
(1) u (cid:2) v , u (cid:2) (cid:6)v
x y y x
are sufficient for a complex function ƒ(z) (cid:2)u(x, y) (cid:5)iv(x, y) to be analytic; precisely, if
the real part u and the imaginary partvofƒ(z) satisfy(1) in a domain D in the complex
plane and if the partial derivatives in(1) arecontinuousin D, thenƒ(z) is analytic in D.
In this proof we write (cid:17)z(cid:2)(cid:17)x(cid:5)i(cid:17)yand (cid:17)ƒ (cid:2)ƒ(z(cid:5)(cid:17)z) (cid:6)ƒ(z). The idea of proof
is as follows.
(a) We express (cid:17)ƒ in terms of first partial derivatives of uand v, by applying the mean
value theorem of Sec. 9.6.
(b) We get rid of partial derivatives with respect to yby applying the Cauchy–Riemann
equations.
(c) We let (cid:17)zapproach zero and show that then (cid:17)ƒ/(cid:17)z,as obtained, approaches a limit,
which is equal to u (cid:5) iv , the right side of (4) in Sec. 13.4, regardless of the way of
x x
approach to zero.
(a) Let P:(x, y) be any fixed point in D.Since Dis a domain, it contains a neighborhood
of P. We can choose a point Q: (x (cid:5) (cid:17)x, y (cid:5) (cid:17)y) in this neighborhood such that the
straight-line segment PQ is in D. Because of our continuity assumptions we may apply
the mean value theorem in Sec. 9.6. This yields
u(x (cid:5) (cid:17)x, y (cid:5) (cid:17)y) (cid:6) u(x, y) (cid:2) ((cid:17)x)u (M ) (cid:5) ((cid:17)y)u (M )

x 2 y 2
where M and M ((cid:4) M in general!) are suitable points on that segment. The first line
1 2 1
is Re(cid:17)ƒ and the second is Im(cid:17)ƒ, so that
(cid:17)ƒ (cid:2) ((cid:17)x)u (M ) (cid:5) ((cid:17)y)u (M ) (cid:5) i[((cid:17)x)v (M ) (cid:5) ((cid:17)y)v (M )].

x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2
Also (cid:17)z (cid:2) (cid:17)x (cid:5) i(cid:17)y, so that we can write (cid:17)x (cid:2) (cid:17)z (cid:6) i(cid:17)y in the first term and
(cid:17)y (cid:2) ((cid:17)z (cid:6) (cid:17)x)/i (cid:2) (cid:6)i((cid:17)z (cid:6) (cid:17)x) in the second term. This gives
(cid:17)ƒ (cid:2) ((cid:17)z (cid:6) i(cid:17)y)u (M ) (cid:5) i((cid:17)z (cid:6) (cid:17)x)v (M ) (cid:5) i[((cid:17)x)v (M ) (cid:5) ((cid:17)y)u (M )].
x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2
By performing the multiplications and reordering we obtain

(cid:2)z x 1 x 1 (cid:2)z x 1 x 2 (cid:2)z x 1 x 2
(c) We finally let (cid:2)zapproach zero and note that (cid:2)(cid:2)y/(cid:2)z(cid:2)(cid:6)1 and (cid:2)(cid:2)x/(cid:2)z(cid:2)(cid:6)1 in (A).
Then Q: (x (cid:4) (cid:2)x, y (cid:4) (cid:2)y) approaches P: (x, y), so that M and M must approach P.
1 2
Also, since the partial derivatives in (A) are assumed to be continuous, they approach
their value at P. In particular, the differences in the braces {•••} in (A) approach zero.
Hence the limit of the right side of (A) exists and is independent of the path along which
(cid:2)z * 0. We see that this limit equals the right side of (4) in Sec. 13.4. This means that
ƒ(z) is analytic at every point z in D, and the proof is complete. (cid:2)

possible directions (Fig. 563), so that the corresponding integrals cancel out in pairs, and
the sum of the integrals on the right equals the integral on the left. We now pick an integral
on the right that is biggest in absolute value and call its path C . Then, by the triangle

APP. 4 Additional Proofs A93
The proof for the case in which C is the boundary of a polygonfollows from the previous
proof by subdividing the polygon into triangles (Fig. 564). The integral corresponding to
each such triangle is zero. The sum of these integrals is equal to the integral over C,
because we integrate along each segment of subdivision in both directions, the
corresponding integrals cancel out in pairs, and we are left with the integral over C.
The case of a general simple closed path C can be reduced to the preceding one by
inscribing in C a closed polygon P of chords, which approximates C “sufficiently
accurately,” and it can be shown that there is a polygon P such that the integral over P
differs from that over C by less than any preassigned positive real number (cid:9)˜, no matter
how small. The details of this proof are somewhat involved and can be found in Ref. [D6]
listed in App. 1. (cid:2)

PROOF OF THEOREM 4 Cauchy’s Convergence Principle for Series
(a) In this proof we need two concepts and a theorem, which we list first.
1. A bounded sequence s , s , ••• is a sequence whose terms all lie in a disk of
1 2
(sufficiently large, finite) radius K with center at the origin; thus (cid:2)s (cid:2) (cid:10) K for all n.
n
2. A limit pointaof a sequence s , s , •••is a point such that, given an (cid:9)(cid:11)0, there
1 2
are infinitely many terms satisfying (cid:2)s (cid:5) a(cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:9). (Note that this does not imply
n
convergence, since there may still be infinitely many terms that do not lie within that
circle of radius (cid:9)and center a.)
Example: _ 1, _ 3, _ 1, _ 7, _ 1, _ 15, ••• has the limit points 0 and 1 and diverges.
4 4 8 8 16 16
3. A bounded sequence in the complex plane has at least one limit point.
(Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem; proof below. Recall that “sequence” always means infinite
sequence.)
(b) We now turn to the actual proof that z (cid:4) z (cid:4) ••• converges if and only if, for
1 2
every (cid:9)(cid:11) 0, we can find an N such that
(1) (cid:2)z (cid:4) ••• (cid:4) z (cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:9) for every n (cid:11) N and p (cid:3) 1, 2, •••.

Here, by the definition of partial sums,
s (cid:5) s (cid:3) z (cid:4) ••• (cid:4) z .
n(cid:4)p n n(cid:4)1 n(cid:4)p
Writing n (cid:4) p (cid:3) r, we see from this that (1) is equivalent to
(1*) (cid:2)s (cid:5) s (cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:9) for all r (cid:11) N and n (cid:11) N.

that is, (1*) holds.
(c) Conversely, assume that s , s , ••• satisfies (1*). We first prove that then the
1 2
sequence must be bounded. Indeed, choose a fixed (cid:18)and a fixed n (cid:2) n (cid:12) N in (1*).

Then (1*) implies that all s with r(cid:12)Nlie in the disk of radius (cid:18)and center s and only
finitely many terms s ,

s may not lie in this disk. Clearly, we can now

so large that this disk and these finitely many terms all lie within this new circle. Hence
the sequence is bounded. By the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, it has at least one limit
point, call it s.
We now show that the sequence is convergent with the limit s. Let (cid:18)(cid:12) 0 be given.
Then there is an N* such that (cid:5)s (cid:6) s (cid:5) (cid:13) (cid:18)/2 for all r (cid:12) N* and n (cid:12) N*, by (1*). Also,

by the definition of a limit point, (cid:5)s (cid:6)s(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:18)/2 for infinitely many n, so that we can find

and fix an n (cid:12) N* such that (cid:5)s (cid:6) s(cid:5) (cid:13) (cid:18)/2. Together, for every r (cid:12) N*,

THEOREM Bolzano–Weierstrass Theorem3
A bounded infinite sequence z , z , z , ••• in the complex plane has at least one
1 2 3
limit point.
PROOF It is obvious that we need both conditions: a finite sequence cannot have a limit point,
and the sequence 1, 2, 3, •••, which is infinite but not bounded, has no limit point. To
prove the theorem, consider a bounded infinite sequence z , z , •••and let Kbe such that
1 2
(cid:5)z (cid:5) (cid:13) K for all n. If only finitely many values of the z are different, then, since the
n n
sequence is infinite, some number z must occur infinitely many times in the sequence,
and, by definition, this number is a limit point of the sequence.
We may now turn to the case when the sequence contains infinitely many different
terms. We draw a large square Q that contains all z . We subdivide Q into four congruent
0 n 0
squares, which we number 1, 2, 3, 4. Clearly, at least one of these squares (each taken
with its complete boundary) must contain infinitely many terms of the sequence. The
square of this type with the lowest number (1, 2, 3, or 4) will be denoted by Q . This is

the first step. In the next step we subdivide Q into four congruent squares and select a

square Q by the same rule, and so on. This yields an infinite sequence of squares Q ,

Q , Q , •••, Q , •••with the property that the side of Q approaches zero as napproaches

infinity, and Q contains all Q with n (cid:12) m. It is not difficult to see that the number
m n
which belongs to all these squares,4call it z(cid:2)a, is a limit point of the sequence. In fact,
given an (cid:18)(cid:12) 0, we can choose an N so large that the side of the square Q is less than
N
(cid:18)and, since Q contains infinitely many z , we have (cid:5)z (cid:6)a(cid:5)(cid:13)(cid:18)for infinitely many n.

(cid:20) is the same with each x replaced by y. We form the sum (cid:21)2(cid:20). In it, (cid:20)* (cid:2) (cid:20)* is
yy vu uv
multiplied by
u v (cid:5) u v
x x y y
which is 0 by the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Also (cid:21)2u(cid:2)0 and (cid:21)2v(cid:2)0. There remains
(cid:21)2(cid:20) (cid:2) (cid:20)* (u2 (cid:5) u2) (cid:5) (cid:20)*(v2 (cid:5) v2).
uu x y vv x y
By the Cauchy–Riemann equations this becomes
(cid:21)2(cid:20) (cid:2)((cid:20)* (cid:5) (cid:20)*)(u2 (cid:5) v2)
uu vv x x
and is 0 since (cid:20)* is harmonic. (cid:2)
